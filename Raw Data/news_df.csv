""The design of the parts and the design of the plant facilitate making the vehicle easier to build.""Reuters got an exclusive look inside Rivian's four-million-square-foot factory, with investors eager to learn more about the size and pace of savings after a three-week shutdown in April.Cutting cost is critical for Rivian and other EV startups as high interest rates have turned some potential customers off EVs that are typically more expensive to buy than their gasoline-powered counterparts. Rivian has never turned a quarterly net profit since it was founded in 2009 and lost $1.5 billion in the first quarter.""We did a similar process of really going through and redesigning a number of components for cost, so we took over 35% of the material cost out of the vans,"" Scaringe said, referring to a January shutdown of the van line. Built primarily for major shareholder Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Rivian's vans account for about one-fifth of its revenue.Market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has slashed prices but some smaller EV makers, including Fisker (OTC:FSRNQ), have filed for bankruptcy. Rivian is on more solid ground financially, but loses nearly $39,000 on every vehicle and is banking on cost savings to help it turn a gross profit this year.WORK SMARTERIn addition to simplified assembly and less equipment at the plant, changes flow into the second generation of Rivian's R1 vehicles with company-built drive units, upgraded software and new battery packs.Making those battery packs is now easier. The modules are redesigned and come in one piece instead of walls and floors that were built separately.The vehicles also come with a new architecture meant to reduce weight and improve manufacturing efficiency, including shedding 1.6 miles of wiring from each vehicle.Those changes have reduced labor time and pushed the rate of assembly on the manufacturing line up about 30%. ""All of that together leads to us being able to get to our path to profitability and be gross-margin positive,"" said Tim Fallon, vice president of manufacturing at the plant. But investors are worried. The plant shutdown meant Rivian is targeting production of 57,000 vehicles - almost the same as last year - and shares in the company have halved this year. Cash and short-term investments fell by about $1.5 billion in the first quarter to just under $8 billion. Rivian had said it has enough capital to launch the less expensive and smaller R2 SUVs in early 2026. Sam Fiorani, vice president at research firm AutoForecast Solutions, who had expected the company to require a cash infusion before summer 2025, said reducing the cost per vehicle gives Rivian breathing room.""Focusing on where the cost savings are is extremely important to the longevity of the company and to calming the fears of any investors,"" he said.To hasten R2 deliveries, Rivian said in March it would start producing its $45,000 five-seat SUV in its Illinois plant, which will be expanded, instead of at a planned $5-billion plant in Georgia. The move will save $2 billion.R2 will account for 155,000 vehicles per year of the increased capacity of 215,000 in Normal, Fallon said. The factory currently has capacity of 150,000 vehicles. ""We've really been able to understand what we need to do to continue to move forward and really be smarter about what we're doing,"" Fallon said.",Neg

CDK has told him that services will likely be down until mid-week. ""We don't want to see this thing drag on,"" Seavitt said.CDK, which reported the outage last week, said on Monday it had begun the restoration process, reiterating that it will take several days to complete.AutoNation and peer Group 1 Automotive (NYSE:GPI) said they were using alternative processes such as manual paperwork to conduct their business. Both said they had taken precautionary steps to protect their data.""The timing of the restoration of other impacted CDK applications remains unclear at this time,"" Group 1 said in a statement.Bloomberg News reported on Friday that a group of hackers claiming responsibility for the attack on CDK's software systems had demanded millions of dollars in ransom to put an end to the hack.A hacking group called BlackSuit is behind the cyberattack on CDK, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, citing a threat analyst at security firm Recorded Future.Seavitt said he hopes CDK pays the ransom so dealers can resume business as usual.Though auto retailers have not outlined any sales hit, analysts have flagged a possible impact.

There are five LNG plants under development in Texas and Louisiana and 16 others on the drawing board in the U.S. looking to secure investment and customers. The five under construction would add a combined 86.6 million metric tons per annum (MTPA) of the superchilled gas, enough to keep the U.S. as the world's largest exporter for years to come. With labor costs jumping as much as 20% since 2021, busting construction budgets and squeezing projected returns for those firms still trying to attract new investors, the fate of some of the early projects has become less certain. Work at Golden Pass LNG, one of the largest U.S. projects, largely halted after its main contractor ran $2.4 billion over the original budget and filed for bankruptcy. Sempra LNG has revisited selecting Bechtel Corp to build its Cameron LNG expansion project to reduce costs, and it has reduced its stake in a Texas project, Port Arthur LNG, on higher construction costs. NextDecade (NASDAQ:NEXT), which is building the first phase of its $18 billion Rio Grande LNG export terminal, achieved a greenlight after recruiting new investors that reduced its original investors' stake after engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) costs rose, analysts said. EXTRA PAY Behind the struggles are costs that skyrocketed after the COVID-19 pandemic. Contractors have raised wages for skilled workers by as much as 20% in three years, and in some cases are having to pay a per diem rate to retain them, said Travis Woods, president of Gulf Coast Industrial Group, which represents over 1,500 contractors in Texas and Louisiana.""Welders, pipefitters and electricians for sure are demanding more to keep them on the job. Per diem in some cases are paid to everyone on the project no matter where they live,"" Woods said.The five plants had on site in excess of 20,000 employees up until Golden Pass LNG's prime contractor Zachry sent home 4,000 workers, according to regulatory filings by the companies and company statements over the last three months. Venture Global LNG, which has Zachry helping build its Plaquemines plant in Louisiana, said the modular nature of the projects has ""insulated us from the significant labor and inflationary challenges that have impacted other projects,” said a spokesperson.Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics show wages for construction workers in the oil and gas pipeline sectors increasing in Louisiana, where many of the new U.S. plants are being built, by 19% in 2023 compared to 2022.""Welders and pipefitters are being offered up to $60 an hour and a sign-on bonus, if they agree to stay through completion,"" added Woods.Data from LNG research and consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group show that between 2021 and 2023 EPC contracts for new LNG plants increased between 18% and 25%. Bechtel Corp, which is the largest U.S. LNG plant contractor and a Zachry rival, declined comment on the situation. The Reston, Virginia-based contractor has been the preferred builder for top U.S. LNG exporter Cheniere Energy (NYSE:LNG), delivering projects using largely lump-sum, turnkey EPC contracts. EPC contractors may look to reduce the scope of their contracts and make more elements cost reimbursable, to lessen the risks, according to Poten & Partners, a LNG shipping and consulting company. ""EPC contractors may now be factoring in a 30% to 40% increase into their lump-sum turnkey contracts,"" it said in a note last month.",Neg

The European Commission, which is also the EU's antitrust and technology regulator, said it had sent its preliminary findings to Apple following an investigation launched in March.The charge against Apple is the first by the Commission under its landmark Digital Markets Act which seeks to rein in the power of Big Tech and ensure a level playing field for smaller rivals. It has until March next year to issue a final decision.DMA violations could result in a fine of as much as 10% of a company's global annual turnover.EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager cited issues with Apple's new terms, saying that they fell short of complying with the DMA. Apple can avoid a fine if it can address the concerns by modifying its business terms.""As they stand, we think that these new terms do not allow app developers to communicate freely with their end users, and to conclude contracts with them,"" she told a conference.She said it was up to Apple to decide how to comply with the DMA and not for her to tell the company what to do.Apple said it had made a number of changes in the past several months to comply with the DMA after getting feedback from app developers and the Commission.""As we have done routinely, we will continue to listen and engage with the European Commission,"" it said in an email.The Commission said under most of the business terms, Apple allows steering only through 'link-outs', meaning that app developers can include a link in their app that redirects the customer to a web page where the customer can conclude a contract.It also criticised the fees charged by Apple for facilitating via the App Store the initial acquisition of a new customer by developers, saying they went beyond what was strictly necessary for such remuneration.""We are confident our plan complies with the law, and estimate more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less in fees to Apple under the new business terms we created,"" Apple said in its email.NEW CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTSThe EU executive said it was also opening an investigation into the iPhone maker over its new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app stores and whether these were necessary and proportionate.At issue is its core technology fee, the multi-step user journey to download and install alternative app stores on iPhones and the eligibility requirements for developers to offer alternative app stores or directly distribute apps from the web on iPhones. Apple rolled out the new fees in March in the EU, which include the core technology fee to major app developers even if they do not use any of its payment services, prompting criticism from ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games and others.Vestager also criticised Apple's announcement last week that it would delay the launch of its AI-powered features of its AI-powered features in the EU which the company blamed on the DMA.

The court will hear the case in its next term, which begins in October.Virginia-based U.S. District Judge Liam O'Grady ruled in favor of Dewberry Engineers in 2021 and later awarded it $43 million of Dewberry Group's profits that he decided stemmed from intentional trademark infringement. The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2023 upheld O'Grady's decisions. Engineering firm Dewberry Engineers began operating in the 1950s, later expanding its business to add real-estate development services in the southeastern United States. Real estate developer John Dewberry in 1989 founded Dewberry Group, which provides similar services through several affiliates. Dewberry Engineers first sued Dewberry Group, then known as Dewberry Capital, for trademark infringement in 2006. The companies settled the case in 2007. Dewberry Capital changed its name to Dewberry Group in 2017 and began offering services under sub-brands including Dewberry Living, Dewberry Office and Studio Dewberry. Dewberry Engineers sent cease-and-desist letters after Dewberry Group applied for federal trademarks covering the brand names.Dewberry Engineers sued Dewberry Group again in 2020 for allegedly infringing its trademarks and breaking their settlement agreement. Dewberry Group told the Supreme Court in February that the lower courts had wrongly held it liable for the actions of affiliates that had not been named in the case.

It is convened by Groundswell - a collaboration between non-profits Global Optimism, Systems Change Lab, and the Bezos Earth Fund.Corporate backers include consumer goods company  Unilever  (LON:ULVR), the world's biggest furniture retailer IKEA and British sustainable energy company Octopus EV. Others are represented through groups such as the We Mean Business Coalition.While some fossil fuel companies have drawn criticism from environmental campaigners, others in business are frustrated by what they see as short-sighted governments reluctant to regulate to bring about necessary change when the evidence climate change is becoming more extreme is mounting.Mission 2025 aims to reassure political leaders they have powerful support for bold action.It is spearheaded by Global Optimism's Christiana Figueres, who oversaw the Paris Agreement in 2015 that produced the first truly global agreement that countries would cut climate-damaging emissions.Ten years on from the Paris deal, the nearly 200 countries who agreed to it have a deadline to put forward updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that lay out a country's policies towards meeting the global goal of reducing emissions.More than two-thirds of annual revenues across the world's biggest companies, totalling $31 trillion, was now aligned with the quest to reach net-zero emissions, the coalition said in a statement, citing data from the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, an independent climate thinktank.A U.N.-backed survey this month of the public's views on climate change across 77 countries, meanwhile, showed 80% of respondents want their governments to take stronger action even though some governments, concerned about re-election and economics, have retreated from previous pledges.Figueres told Reuters a ""lack of leadership"" and political noise were to blame for insufficient policy to drive the cleaner technologies that have shown themselves to be cheaper, better-performing, faster to construct and a safer investment than their incumbent rivals.""The political economy is very clear that the future is one of decarbonisation,"" she said.More clarity from governments over the direction of public policy was needed to give confidence to companies and others in the real economy to invest more in the transition to a low-carbon economy over the period to 2035.""We think that governments are still very timid about what they're going to be including in their NDCs,"" she said, citing opposition from companies and others tied to the fossil fuel economy, which she said smacked of desperation.UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell told delegates at a climate conference in Bonn this month that the NDCs needed to cover ""every sector and all greenhouse gases"".  To help empower governments to go further, the Mission 2025 coalition would provide the data needed to justify the policy changes, with a focus on the 20 largest economies, responsible for the bulk of emissions, Figueres said.""Those will be the ones that we will be focusing more on.

This revised estimate is below the 445,000 consensus on Visible Alpha and sits at the higher end of buy-side expectations, which UBS gauges at 410,000-425,000.UBS highlights that ""the stock tends to react more towards results vs. the headline (consensus) figure,"" suggesting the final delivery number might hold more weight than the initial miss. They plan to revisit their financial model after official figures are released.Looking at specific regions, UBS expects deliveries in the US to be slightly below Q1's pace. However, they believe May's 0.99% financing offer for Model Y might have pulled some sales forward from June. An improvement in Model 3 deliveries is also expected due to resolved production challenges.In Europe, deliveries are estimated to be down sharply year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to declining demand in key markets. China, however, is a bright spot, with deliveries showing a modest increase year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter.Beyond deliveries, UBS cautions that gross margins might be impacted despite an expected improvement in US and China deliveries.While the upcoming ""Tesla AI Day"" on August 8th might generate excitement around AI initiatives, UBS believes their financial impact is further out. The focus for the near-to-mid term will be on the new vehicle reveal, which could influence 2025 and 2026 estimates.UBS expects the new vehicle to be distinct from the Model 3 and Y but with fewer features to achieve a lower price point.UBS concludes by suggesting Tesla's stock price might diverge from current business fundamentals as investor focus shifts towards future growth and AI prospects.",Neg

The complaints said Suno and Udio users have been able to recreate elements of songs including The Temptations' ""My Girl,"" Mariah Carey's ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" and James Brown's ""I Got You (I Feel Good),"" and could generate vocals that are ""indistinguishable"" from musicians such as Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen and ABBA.

The justices asked the lower court to reconsider the case.Hundreds of American service members and civilians, and their families, sued the defendant companies, part of five corporate families: AstraZeneca,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), GE Healthcare USA, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and F. Hoffmann-La Roche.The plaintiffs accused major U.S. and European pharmaceutical and device makers of providing corrupt payments to the Hezbollah-sponsored militia group Jaysh al-Mahdi in order to obtain medical supply contracts from Iraq's health ministry. The plaintiffs alleged the militia group controlled the health ministry.The lawsuit, brought in 2017 in federal court in Washington, seeks unspecified damages under the Anti-Terrorism Act, a federal law that lets Americans pursue claims related to ""an act of international terrorism.""A federal trial judge in 2020 dismissed the lawsuit, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2022 overturned that decision and let the case move ahead.The companies have denied wrongdoing and said they ""are not responsible in any way for the tragic events that were caused and carried out by Iraqi militia groups.""In a joint statement, the pharmaceutical and device companies on Monday said they welcomed the Supreme Court's ruling.

The investment bank reiterated its optimism toward the market due to solid and broadening profit growth, disinflation, and a Fed pivot to rate cuts. This, coupled with rising AI infrastructure investments, has driven the S&P 500 to new record highs. Despite cooling growth readings, strategists believe the economy is stable, supported by a robust labor market. Low initial jobless claims, 1.2 open jobs per unemployed worker, and rising real wages indicate continued consumer spending strength. Jobs are still being added in construction and manufacturing, key cyclical sectors, UBS highlighted.In addition, while first-quarter inflation was higher than expected, it softened in the second quarter.“We expect this disinflation trend to continue,” the UBS team noted.“Pricing power for corporate America continues to moderate, wage pressures are easing, consumer inflation expectations remain well contained, and the shelter component of the government's inflation data should continue to moderate,” they added.This, in turn, should pave the way for the Fed to begin cutting interest rates later in the year. UBS expects a total of two cuts in 2024, with the first one anticipated in September. “With the Fed now in a position to cut rates in case economic growth falters, this should limit the scope of potential downside risks for stocks,” strategists continued.Meanwhile, Q1 earnings results were better than expected, noted UBS, adding it was particularly impressed by the guidance and the fact that earnings per share (EPS) growth is beginning to broaden beyond the Magnificent 7 group. AI trends were particularly strong, fueled by an increase in capital spending by the mega-cap companies. “We think the underlying demand will remain robust as the tech companies jockey for the pole position in the emerging AI ecosystem, and companies across the economy look to deploy AI tools into their business processes.”As a result, UBS now sees S&P 500 EPS increasing by 11% in 2024 to $250 and by 6% in 2025 to $265, “which could prove to be conservative,” it noted. Overall, strategists believe the environment remains favorable for U.S. equities, recommending a full allocation to the asset class.

The union, one of the biggest in the country with more than 43,000 members, said that almost 90% of its members had approved strike action unless the company accepts the union's demands. A strike would mark the first such action in six years related to wage negotiations at the South Korean carmaker and could disrupt production of some popular vehicles at home, which Hyundai has been exporting to offset its sluggish domestic sales. ""We are open to have negotiations with the management if they are willing to change their stance,"" a Hyundai Motor (OTC:HYMTF) union official told Reuters, adding that the union plans to carry out working-level talks with the management. The union and the management had a total of eight rounds of wage negotiations up to mid-June. Hyundai Motor declined to comment. Analysts said it is still too early to tell whether or not the union would actually launch a strike this year, but if a strike takes place it would inevitably impact Hyundai's short-term sales, especially for the popular cars sold in the United States, Hyundai's biggest revenue-generating market. Analysts added that Hyundai Motor's management could use the automaker's new U.S. plant, its largest investment outside South Korea, as bargaining leverage because it could help reduce Hyundai's dependence on domestic production. The union is seeking a minimum basic monthly pay increase of 159,800 won ($115.14) and performance pay equating to 30% of Hyundai's 2023 net profit. It is also demanding an increase in the retirement age to 64 from 60, as South Korea's rising life expectancy and inadequate retirement pension payments prompt demands to be able to work for longer.""Hyundai Motor's union at home has always voted for strike action every year and this year is no different, however, the union might push a bit harder than previous years as the company has been doing well and the pandemic is long gone, so workers would like to push for bigger compensation this time,"" said Chang Moonsu, an analyst at Hyundai Motor Securities.While production disruptions at Hyundai's domestic factories would be inevitable, management would encourage workers not participating in the strike to work overtime to minimize the impact, Chang added.

The China-founded company, which was valued at $66 billion in a fundraising round last year, began to explore a listing on the London Stock Exchange early this year, Reuters reported in May, citing sources. Shein's original plan to list in New York came unstuck following opposition from U.S. lawmakers.A spokesperson for Shein and a spokesperson for Britain's markets watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), declined to comment.Both the sources, who have knowledge of the deal, declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.It is not immediately clear when Shein, known for its $5 tops and $10 dresses, plans to launch the initial public offering (IPO). Shein has updated China's securities regulator officially about its change of listing venue, said the sources. The company, however, has yet to receive a nod from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), one of them said.The CSRC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.The FCA would typically take up to a couple of months to vet and decide on clearance.With a green light from both the FCA and CSRC, Shein would be in a position to publicly file an intention to float on the London stock exchange.That would kick-off a typically four-week process of book building and price guidance before admission to trading.If Shein does decide to press the button on a UK listing it will likely have to deal with a new government.Opinion polls say Keir Starmer's Labour Party is on course to easily win Britain's July 4 election and end the 14 year rule of the Conservatives.Labour has met with Shein and indicated its support for its potential London listing, which would be a boost for a UK market that has seen several high profile companies choose other venues.However, some senior lawmakers have questioned Shein's suitability and called for greater scrutiny of its labour practices, supply chain and use of an import tax exemption.Shein has said it is investing in strengthening governance and compliance across its supply chain and that the duty-free treatment of low-value parcels is not critical to its success.Shein's London filing marks a shift from its long-running U.S. IPO plan, which has run into obstacles at home and abroad, Reuters has reported.The group confidentially filed for an IPO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in November and approached the CSRC to seek Beijing's nod in the same month, sources have said.The CSRC earlier this year informed Shein that the regulator would not recommend a U.S. IPO due to the company's supply chain issues, Reuters has reported.Last week, Italian luxury sneaker maker Golden Goose postponed its IPO on the Milan bourse because of market volatility arising from political uncertainty, illustrating the challenging environment for new listings in Europe.",Pos

The broad-based S&P 500 index is up almost 15% so far this year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has gained almost 18%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average has lagged, by contrast, gaining just under 4% in the first half of the year. These healthy gains open up the possibility of profit-taking, with as much as 52% of respondents to a Bloomberg survey saying they believe the S&P 500 is overpriced.Moreover, 49% of respondents said they see the next S&P 500 10% correction to start sometimes in 2024. Similarly, 55% said they expect to keep the same S&P 500 exposure over the next month.Markets are focused chiefly this week on PCE inflation data, which is due Friday. The reading is the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, and is likely to tie into the central bank’s stance on interest rate cuts.The PCE reading is expected to show inflation cooled slightly in May, but remained well above the Fed’s 2% annual target. Expectations of an eventual lowering in interest rates had driven Wall Street indexes to record highs through June, even as the Fed signaled that sticky inflation and a strong economy kept chances of such a scenario slim. Some key quarterly earning prints were also on tap this week.Delivery and logistics firm FedEx (NYSE:FDX), whose earnings are also viewed as a bellwether for global economic activity, is set to report its earnings for the quarter ended May on Tuesday. Memory chip maker Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is set to report its quarterly earnings on Wednesday, after forecasting a major demand spike from the fast growing artificial intelligence industry. Sports apparel maker  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and pharmaceutical retailer Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) are set to report earnings on Thursday.Crude prices stabilized Monday after the previous week’s positive tone on signs of stronger oil products demand in the U.S., world's largest consumer.By 09:35 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.1% lower at $80.66 a barrel, while the Brent contract edged higher to $84.35 per barrel.Both benchmarks gained around 3% last week after data from the Energy Information Administration showed a hefty drawdown in U.S. crude stockpiles, pointing to healthy demand as the summer driving season kicks into top gear.The market also received support from worsening geopolitical conditions as the risk of an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah, as an extension of the conflict with Hamas, rises, playing into expectations of supply disruptions in the Middle East. Continued clashes between Russia and Ukraine, with Kyiv targeting major Russian refineries, also spurred concerns over supply disruptions. (Ambar Warrick contributed to this article.)",Neutral

Vyvgart secured a broad label in CIDP and the higher net pricing in this indication should offer upside to Street models,” analysts at Wells Fargo said, in a note dated June 23.The U.S. bank expects the CIDP launch to exceed expectations, with  Vyvgart likely to come close to $2 billion in sales in the 2024 financial year. “While we also expect ARGX's pipeline to notch some wins, the key for upside in the near term will be commercial execution on the CIDP launch and upward revisions to Street estimates.”",Pos

The multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide compared to a placebo. Study 1 included obese adults with OSA who were not using PAP therapy, while Study 2 involved those using PAP therapy during the trial. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of tirzepatide (10mg or 15mg) or a placebo.The primary objective was to demonstrate tirzepatide's superiority over placebo in reducing the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) after 52 weeks. The trials achieved all primary and key secondary endpoints, showing a mean AHI reduction of up to 62.8%, equivalent to about 30 fewer events per hour of sleep.

39,"6/24/2024, 08:44 AM","Should investors choose Treasury or Corporate Bonds, or MBS?","In today's investment landscape, fixed income options remain a crucial component of a balanced portfolio. These investments, often referred to as bonds, offer investors a steady stream of income payments and a return on their principal investment at maturity.In a recent investment research note, BCA Research considered the relative merits of four different fixed income investments in the current economic environment: 2-year Treasuries, 10-year Treasuries, Baa-rated corporate bonds and current coupon Agency MBS (Mortgage-Backed Securities).The investment firm said they estimate returns for both the 2-year and 10-year Treasury notes in three different economic scenarios: a recession scenario, a soft landing scenario, and a status quo scenario.For the recession scenario, the firm based its assumptions on what happened in the two most recent pre-COVID recessions (2001 and 2008).It assessed how bond yields moved during the 12-month periods spanning from six months before the first Fed rate cut to six months after. As a result, it assumes a 287 bps drop in the 2-year Treasury yield and a 134 bps drop in the 10-year.The soft landing scenario assumes inflation gradually trends back toward the Fed’s target but that the labor market holds firm and a recession is avoided.BCA says this causes the Fed to cut rates at a pace of 25 bps per quarter starting in September. “Additionally, we assume that the market anticipates further modest policy easing at the end of our 12-month investment horizon, so our 12-month Fed Funds discounter rises from its current -123 bps but remains below zero at -50 bps,” says BCA.“This gives us a target of 3.95% for the 2-year yield, 77 bps below current levels. We additionally assume a modest steepening of the 2/10 curve, though we keep it inverted at -10 Bps,” they add. “This gives us a 10-year yield target of 3.85%, 37 bps below current levels.”Finally, they state the status quo scenario is designed to be a baseline where the Fed keeps the policy rate unchanged while the market still anticipates that the next move will be a cut.“An assumption of no change in the fed funds rate and a 12-month Discounter rising to -50 bps gives us a target of 4.94% for the 2-year Treasury yield, 22 bps above current levels,” writes BCA. “Additionally, we assume no change in 2/10 slope in this scenario, so the 10-year yield also rises by 22 bps.”According to BCA Research analysts, the 10-year Treasury note is the pure duration play.“It compensates investors for taking interest rate risk but has no exposure to credit or convexity risk,” they explain.According to BCA, the Baa-rated corporate bond carries a fair amount of both interest rate risk and credit risk.“While in one sense this makes the corporate bond the most dangerous choice, the bond also benefits from the fact that returns for taking credit risk and returns for taking interest rate risk tend to be negatively correlated,” says the firm.The investment firm feels that the soft landing scenario is where corporate bonds shine, noting the combination of falling Treasury yields and tightening corporate bond spreads as being a huge boon for the sector.In this scenario, they believe Baa-rated corporate bonds outperform the 1-year risk-free rate by 3.90% in the soft landing scenario, compared to 1.85% and 1.10% outperformance for the 10-year and 2-year Treasury notes.“Discount Agency MBS are those securities currently trading at less than $0.98 on the dollar. These securities make up about 85% of the Bloomberg Agency MBS index and have an average coupon of 2.77%,” explains BCA. “Current coupon Agency MBS are a much smaller proportion of the index. They trade close to par and have an average coupon of 5.29%.”In addition, current coupon MBS have a lower duration than discount MBS and offer a significant yield advantage.The firm says the relative merits of the current coupon Agency MBS become apparent when risk is considered alongside expected return.“Agency MBS perform reasonably well in both the recession and soft landing scenarios with minimal variance,” states BCA.According to BCA, the current coupon Agency MBS offers the best investment value in US fixed-income markets.“Investors should hold overweight positions in the sector and underweight positions in corporate bonds,” they argue. BCA also continues to recommend keeping portfolio duration at neutral until clearer signs of labor market deterioration emerge.Investing in bonds is a strategic way to ensure portfolio stability and reliable income. Bonds, whether from governments or corporations, offer lower volatility compared to stocks and are vital for risk management. On Investing.com, the Bonds section features comprehensive data on interest rates, bond prices, and yield curves, helping investors navigate the fixed income market effectively.",Neutral

Beijing does not want to be embroiled in another tariff war, still stung by U.S. tariffs on its goods imposed by the Trump administration, but says it would take all steps to protect Chinese firms should one happen.China's Global Times, citing observers, said the best outcome would be for the EU to scrap its tariff plans before July 4.Analysts and European trade lobby groups stressed that China would need to come to negotiations willing to make major concessions.Alicia Garcia Herrero, senior fellow at Bruegel, an influential EU affairs think tank, doubted the planned curbs could be dropped before elections in France on June 30 and July 7.""The Commission can't change a decision it has been pondering for months on months on months,"" she added. ""Yes, China is putting pressure on the member states, but they would need to vote with a qualified majority against the Commission.""The European Commission is set to make a final decision on tariffs by Nov. 2 at the end of the anti-subsidy investigation.The Chinese commerce ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.TALKS ARE A 'GOOD SIGN'Siegfried Russwurm, head of Germany's biggest industry association BDI, said it was a ""good sign"" both sides would hold talks.""You know the old saying: as long as there are talks you're not shooting at each other,"" he told German public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk.Russwurm, who also serves as chairman for German conglomerate and car supplier Thyssenkrupp (ETR:TKAG), said tariffs were the last thing Germany needed as a major exporting nation.At the same time, Brussels' move to apply tariffs of varying degrees suggested a thorough analysis had taken place and that this was not an effort that targeted the entire Chinese car sector in equal measure.Meantime, Maximilian Butek, executive director at the German Chamber of Commerce in China, said there was ""zero chance"" the preliminary tariffs would be removed by July 4 unless China eliminated all the issues flagged by the European Commission.EU trade policy has turned increasingly protective over concerns that China's production-focused development model could see it flooded with cheap goods as Chinese firms look to step up exports amid weak domestic demand.China has rejected accusations of unfair subsidies or that it has an overcapacity problem, saying the development of its EV industry has been the result of advantages in technology, market and industry supply chains. ""When European Commission President Von der Leyen announced she would investigate China's new energy vehicles ... I had an intuitive feeling it was not only an economic issue but also a geopolitical issue,"" said Zhang Yansheng, chief research fellow at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges.ARMED AND READYAlthough calling for talks, Beijing has also indicated it has retaliatory measures ready if the EU does not back down, and that it considers Brussels wholly responsible for the escalating tensions.China has opened an anti-dumping investigation into EU pork imports. The Global Times said China was also teeing up an anti-subsidy investigation into European dairy goods and tariffs on large-engined petrol cars.Chinese authorities have dropped hints about possible retaliatory measures through state media commentaries and interviews with industry figures.""It seems probable that Beijing will raise tariffs up to 25% for Europe-made cars with 2.5 or above litre engines,"" said Jacob Gunter, lead analyst at Berlin-based China studies institute MERICS.""Pork and dairy are already on the table for Beijing, and likely more agricultural products will be threatened,"" he added.""On the EU side, there are a variety of ongoing investigations ... so we should expect some sort of measures targeting distortions on (Chinese) products ranging from medical devices to airport security scanners to steel pipes.""",Neutral

WHAT IS TIM SELLING?TIM's fibre and copper landline network covers nearly 89% of the country's households and its fibre cable stretches over 23 million kilometres (14.3 million miles) across the country, making it the main piece of Italy's telecoms infrastructure. WHAT WILL TIM LOOK LIKE AFTER THE SALE?TIM will shift more than half of its domestic workforce on to the network venture, leaving it with some 16,000 employees in Italy. It will reduce its leverage by 14 billion euros ($15.02 billion) to 1.6-1. times its core earnings when including lease costs.Under a business plan overseen by Chief Executive Pietro Labriola, the network sale is intended to give TIM greater commercial flexibility to compete in the domestic retail service market and the opportunity to explore M&A deals and partnerships.The main units of the residual business are TIM Consumer, TIM Enterprise, providing connectivity, cloud and cybersecurity services for bigger business customers, and TIM Brasil, its Brazilian operation.WHY IS TIM SELLING THE NETWORK?Crippled by 27 billion euros in net debt, cash-burning TIM has resorted to hiving off its main asset after years of fruitless efforts to restructure its domestic business, whose earnings and revenue have been shrinking for years.Grappling with stiff price competition on its home turf, TIM also came under increasing pressure as interest rates rose. HOW MUCH IS THE DEAL WORTH?KKR, which was already a minority investor in a portion of TIM's grid, valued TIM's network at up to 22 billion euros, including some 3 billion euros in variable components mostly linked to a future potential combination of the assets with those of state-backed rival network operator Open Fiber.WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT?Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's right-wing administration endorsed the deal as part of a wider agreement to co-invest in the network, taking a stake of up to 20% in an asset deemed of strategic importance.WHO ARE KKR'S OTHER PARTNERS IN THE NETWORK DEAL?Italian infrastructure fund F2i will hold a 10% stake in the venture, while Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund ADIA and Canada Pension Plan will hold a 20% stake and 17.5% stake respectively. WHAT ABOUT TIM INVESTORS?So far investors have shown little enthusiasm for the reshaped TIM. Shares plunged 24% when Labriola unveiled the outlook for the new business in March and the stock has remained depressed.Leading TIM shareholder Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) is challenging TIM's decision to sell the network in courts and questioned the sustainability of the business left behind.($1 = 0.9321 euros)($1 = 0.9320 euros)",Pos

The Nasdaq ended the week flat, while the Dow saw a 1.45% increase, marking its best weekly performance since May.This week, the markets will largely be focused on important economic developments, most notably the durable goods report on Thursday, followed by the core PCE and University of Michigan reports on Friday. In addition, several Fed officials are scheduled to speak, including Governor Waller on Monday and New York Fed President Williams on Sunday.For PCE data, economists at Goldman Sachs believe that personal income increased by 0.4% and personal spending grew by 0.26% in May.“We estimate that the core PCE price index rose +0.13%, corresponding to a year-over-year rate of 2.59%,” Goldman economists said in a note. “ Additionally, we expect that the headline PCE price index increased by 0.03% from the prior month, corresponding to a year-over-year rate of 2.51%.”The Q2 earnings season is nearing its end, though several significant reports are still yet to be released to close out the period.Investors’ attention will particularly be focused on the upcoming Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) print, an AI memory chipmaker whose shares surged more than 60% this year amid the ongoing bull market. Micron will report the results on Wednesday following the market’s close.Two other major reports that will be in the spotlight will be those by FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively.In addition, companies like Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI), and McCormick & Company (NYSE:MKC) will also report this week.RBC Capital Markets: “We’ve added a new stress test to our valuation analysis. This is an optimistic scenario which bakes in lower inflation, lower 10-year yields, and more Fed cuts than the current consensus.”“These assumptions imply that a reasonable trailing P/E for the S&P 500 at year-end would be around 22.5x and that a fair value for the index would be 5,500. That 5,500 index level is close to recent highs. While we consider our valuation model to be a compass, not a GPS, our work here nevertheless continues to make us worry that the US equity market has gotten a little ahead of itself in the short term due to a little too much optimism around interest rates and inflation after the latest CPI print/Fed meeting.”Evercore ISI: “Stocks are expensive and will remain so as S&P 500 is forecast to end the year at 6,000. But as the history of past “expensive markets” illustrates, some of the strongest gains can occur once stocks become expensive.“What makes each of the prior “expensive markets” unique is their own trajectory with regard to time, price, earnings and breadth. Common to all, valuation alone is not sufficient to sell. 2024’s “expensive” market is driven by the promise of the AI Revolution, a Fed willing to cut interest rates for the “right” reasons, a period still relatively small in terms of duration and gains, the prospect of a return to earnings growth in 2024, and relatively robust breadth despite Mag 7 doing much of the lifting.”Morgan Stanley: “With macro data broadly coming in softer YTD, many lower quality and economically sensitive areas of the market have lagged, while a narrow list of higher quality mega caps have carried performance. In our view, this is a sign the market is becoming more focused on growth softening and less focused on inflation and rates. The underperformance of small caps despite falling rates is a good example of this phenomenon. This backdrop syncs with our long-standing view that the current policy mix of heavy fiscal and higher front end rates is effectively crowding out many economic participants.”BTIG: “Last week saw some of the biggest inflows on record into large-cap tech/growth funds. That feels like a sign of froth after the run we have had. We remain concerned about a near-term unwind of many YTD leaders. With that said, even within the 'Mag 7' we are seeing dispersion and charts like AMZN and GOOGL are still constructive and not overly stretched. If the SPX is going to avoid a bigger pullback into July, bulls need to see continued rotation below the surface.”UBS: “As we have said over the past several months, we believe the market backdrop remains favorable due to: 1) solid and broadening profit growth, 2) disinflation, 3) a Fed pivoting to rate cuts, and 4) surging investment in AI infrastructure and applications. These trends have propelled the S&P 500 to a string of all-time highs.”“As a result of the healthy economic growth and surging investment in AI, we look for S&P 500 EPS to rise 11% in 2024 (to USD 250) and 6% in 2025 (to USD 265), which could prove to be conservative. Overall, we believe the environment remains supportive for US equities and investors should have a full allocation to the asset class. Our S&P 500 targets are 5,500 for year-end and 5,600 for June 2025.”",Neutral

And while most vehicles sold in China are made locally, many top-end models are still imported from Germany.Most exposed is Porsche, majority-owned by Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p). It has no production in China and imports all cars sold there, equivalent to 25% of global sales.GERMAN CARMAKERSLess than 5% of the 4.8 million vehicles delivered by Volkswagen, Porsche, BMW (ETR:BMWG) and Mercedes-Benz (OTC:MBGAF) to customers in China were exported in 2023, data from autos association VDA shows.Reports have indicated a counter-tariff by China would apply to cars with an engine of 2.5 litres or larger. Cars imported to China of that size account for around 1% of VW sales, rising to 2% for BMW, 4% for Mercedes and 17% for Porsche, according to Stifel Research.Still, given that exported cars tend to be higher-end models with substantial profit margins, Stifel estimates the negative impact on the German carmakers' operating profit (EBIT) would be significant at between 4-10%.PORSCHEPorsche cars are overwhelmingly produced in Germany, despite 25% of sales in China.Still, Porsche's luxury branding could allow it to raise prices more than mass-market carmakers in the event of counter-tariffs being imposed, HSBC analysts said in a note this month.Deliveries in China were down 15% last year to 79,283 vehicles, and suffered a further drop of 24% in the first quarter of 2024, a decline in part attributed to the difficult economic situation in the country.Porsche is building a research and development site in Shanghai and premiered a tailored version of the Taycan for the Chinese market at the Beijing auto show.VOLKSWAGENVolkswagen has the lowest exposure to counter-tariffs, with just 2.5% of cars sold in China made in Germany, its full-year statement shows.Still, given its ambitions to protect and even boost its market share of 14.5% to 15% despite stiff competition from local carmakers, the company would suffer greatly under boycotts or other counter-measures to punish German companies in China.Volkswagen Group China, including Porsche, and its Chinese joint ventures, sold more than 3.2 million cars in 2023, of which 3.06 million were locally produced.Audi, Volkswagen's premium brand, has a slightly higher share of imported vehicles in local sales at just over 8%.MERCEDES-BENZChina is Mercedes-Benz's largest market for new car sales, accounting for around 36% of unit sales, just over 737,000 in 2023.Just over 80% of cars sold in China in 2023 were made locally, with the rest imported. Its GLE SUV and S Class sedans are among the top three most popular imported cars in China alongside the Porsche Cayenne, according to data tracked by China Merchants Bank International.Mercedes-Benz imports top-end models like the S-Class, GLC, G-Class and Maybach from Europe and the USA to China, where it prefers to build smaller cars like the A-class, E-class and C-class.BMWBMW generates nearly a third of vehicle sales in China, totalling just above 826,000, of which around 13% come from imported cars, its annual report shows.Imported models from Germany include the i4, the 7 Series and the 5 series. The 'Neue Klasse', the carmaker's long-awaited new model series, will be produced locally from 2026.BMW's China-made cars are produced by joint ventures including China's Brilliance Automotive, in which it holds a 75% stake, and a second JV with Great Wall Motor Co.Both these JVs also produce vehicles for export to Europe, the iX3 and an electric Mini, which will be subject to the European Commission's tariffs.EUROPEAN PEERSSwedish carmaker Volvo (OTC:VLVLY) Car, majority-owned by China's Geely, generates a quarter of its unit sales in China but only around 10% of profits, HSBC analysts said.Sales of imported vehicles make up about 4% of Volvo's Chinese sales, with the rest produced locally.Franco-Italian Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) has one of the lowest regional exposures to China, with the exception of its recent investment in Chinese EV maker Leapmotor (HK:9863), with which it plans to export two EV models from China by year-end.Like other luxury carmakers, all of Ferrari (NYSE:RACE)'s sales in China are imports - but these make up just 9% of global sales, with growth concentrated in the United States.Stellantis-owned Ferrari could also leverage its pricing power to pass on tariffs to customers. French automaker  Renault  (EPA:RENA) has low exposure to China, where it operates through joint ventures with Jiangling Motors and Brilliance Auto, and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) which has a market share of roughly 3%.Its Dacia Spring EV is manufactured in China by local partner Dongfeng.Renault and China's Geely announced a joint venture in May to develop combustion and hybrid engines.(This story has been corrected to say that Mercedes-Benz' sales in China accounted for 36% of global total in 2023, not 30%, in paragraph 20)",Neg

As much as 52% of respondents said they believe the S&P 500 is overpriced compared to these two assets.Moreover, 49% of respondents said they see the next S&P 500 10% correction to start sometimes in 2024. Similarly, 55% said they expect to keep the same S&P 500 exposure over the next month.On the median basis, the S&P 500 is seen closing the year at 5606, while the U.S. 10-year yield is expected to be at 4%.31% said the key factor behind the expected correction is negative surprise on the AI front, followed by an increase in unemployment (27%) and pickup in inflation (24%), which would force the Federal Reserve to keep rates higher for longer.On the other hand, the surveyed investors picked value stocks as the biggest bargain in the US stock market, followed by small stocks and the equal-weight S&P 500.Finally, the S&P 500 rally broadening and shortening U.S. dollar are seen as trades that are most likely to prove wrong by the end of the year. Wall Street has been aligning its forecasts for the S&P 500 recently, with Citi revising its year-end 2024 target up to 5,600. The forecast, extending into 2025, anticipates a mid-year target of 5,700 and a year-end target of 5,800.Citi's strategy team, recognizing the influence of mega-cap growth stocks and various market risks, has also set a full-year earnings estimate at $250 and initiated a $270 estimate for 2025.Goldman Sachs has similarly increased its S&P 500 price target to 5,600, attributing the rise to robust earnings growth from key tech companies, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which together account for a quarter of the index's market capitalization.The broker also acknowledged the role of AI advancements and investor optimism in this upward revision.Evercore ISI analysts have raised their year-end S&P 500 target to a Street-high 6,000, citing the transformative potential of AI technology. The firm's outlook is based on an economic environment characterized by slowing inflation, the possibility of Federal Reserve rate cuts, and steady growth. All three financial institutions—Citi Group, Goldman Sachs, and Evercore ISI—have expressed caution regarding potential market downturns and the upcoming U.S. elections in November, which could introduce volatility to the S&P 500.",Neg

""Sometimes you're lucky.""Still, it is far from clear whether their gradual expansion will seriously challenge UBS, whose market strength is already making some firms uneasy, and has caused concerns at the Swiss competition watchdog COMCO.Credit Suisse, which unravelled after a string of scandals, was long regarded by Swiss industry as the natural partner for business in a banking landscape it dominated alongside UBS.""Shortly after the collapse of Credit Suisse, corporates immediately opened discussions with foreign banks like us,"" said Jürg Hobi, head of Citi's Swiss commercial banking arm.Citi, which in September 2022 began serving smaller local firms with international business, was benefitting from concerns about over-dependency on a single bank and a shortage of credit, Hobi said.Today, Citi employs eight staff in Swiss commercial banking, and aims to double that by 2028.Nicola Tettamanti, president of Swissmechanic, which represents small and medium-sized industrial companies in Switzerland, welcomed the moves by foreign banks, although he said the benefits might take some time to filter down.    ""As a fan of competition I am quite comfortable with more players in the market, which will lead to improved services and better prices,"" he told Reuters.""I think they will focus on the big companies first, but the smaller companies will eventually see the benefits after the banks have built up their business,"" added Tettamanti, who also wanted Swiss banks to do well abroad.COMPETITION FEARSAt Deutsche Bank, 50 people work at its Swiss corporate banking arm, 10% more than at the start of 2023, said Veronique Voser, head of the unit for Germany, Switzerland and Austria.The fall of Credit Suisse helped to convince the German bank to expand in Switzerland and take on businesses with annual turnover of at least 500 million Swiss francs ($560 million), she said.""We managed both to win new business and increase our business volumes with existing customers,"" Voser said, pointing to double-digit revenue growth in 2022 and 2023.But UBS, easily Switzerland's biggest bank, looms over them all.Choice for retail banking clients, for the wealthy and for large corporations like Nestle, Roche and  Novartis  (SIX:NOVN) may still be broad - but smaller firms feel less comfortable.""In terms of the loans financing, I've seen instances where competitors have been increasing pricing and the clients have asked us to step in as an alternative"", said BNP's Pariset.Swiss financial regulator FINMA last week said the UBS-Credit Suisse takeover had not created competition worries, despite concerns flagged by antitrust authority COMCO.COMCO said the deal warranted a deeper review and that there were no ""fully-fledged alternatives"" in corporate banking to UBS, urging authorities to encourage ""effective competition"".Asked about the competitive landscape, a UBS spokesperson pointed to previous statements from the bank in which it has, among other things, rejected criticism about its size. UBS's Switzerland boss, Sabine Keller-Busse, told the Neue Zuercher Zeitung newspaper this month that rival banks had been looking to poach its clients ever since Credit Suisse failed.Brooke Wachtel, Bank of America's head of corporate banking in Switzerland, said the window of opportunity was closing. ""Corporates are seeking new banking partners and are expected to fill this gap within the next 12 to 18 months,"" she said.Mainly serving firms with sales upwards of 200 million francs, BNP has risen to become number two in the Swiss franc-denominated bond market, and wants to move into share buybacks, said country head Pariset.BNP saw opportunities among smaller exporters, Pariset added, noting it had hired some 50 staff in corporate and investment banking since 2022 - about a dozen of them from Credit Suisse.($1 = 0.8935 Swiss francs)",Neutral

47,"6/24/2024, 07:55 AM",Hochtief AG: An investment with potential - Jefferies bets on rising prices,"Investing.com - The stock of Hochtief AG is soaring today. Investment bank Jefferies has upgraded its rating of Hochtief stock to ""Buy"" and raised the price target to EUR 124. This assessment is based on the company's strong market position in the globally growing data center sector and the promising prospects for accelerated profit growth.Jefferies analysts see a return potential of about 16% compared to the current price of EUR 107.60. In the most optimistic scenario, the so-called Bull Case, the stock price could even rise to EUR 162.The Jefferies report highlights Hochtief's position as a key player in the data center market, where they are the global number one. These centers, which form the backbone of modern data infrastructure, are increasingly driven by the use of GPU servers (Graphics Processing Unit). Unlike traditional CPUs (Central Processing Unit), these high-performance servers consume significantly more power, creating a higher demand for data center infrastructure. This demand is further intensified by the rapid spread of AI (Artificial Intelligence) technologies.Jefferies forecasts an annual demand growth for data centers of 30-40% in key regions. This presents an enormous opportunity for Hochtief, which is already involved in numerous high-tech infrastructure projects.A key factor in Jefferies' positive assessment is the expected accelerated profit growth at Hochtief. The company is increasingly focusing on projects with higher margins and lower risks. Particularly, Turner Construction, a subsidiary of Hochtief in the US, is highlighted as a growth driver. Margins of 3% are forecasted for 2024, and even 3.5% for 2026, with further growth in the following years.This positive development has prompted Jefferies to raise profit estimates for Hochtief by 3 to 11%. Compared to European competitors, Hochtief has been given a premium valuation.In addition to positive price development, Jefferies analysts also point to an attractive dividend yield of 5.4% for 2025. The combination of dividend yield and double-digit profit growth, driven by increasing demand for advanced technology infrastructure, makes the stock an attractive investment, according to the report.Jefferies also addressed concerns about reinvestment risks associated with ACS/Hochtief. While these risks are higher at ACS due to its holdings in Abertis and Iridium, Hochtief offers a focused and cleaner investment opportunity, according to Jefferies.Another supportive factor for Hochtief stock is the increasing stake of ACS. The Spanish construction company has continuously increased its stake in Hochtief from about 55% to 76% since 2022. Jefferies states: ""We expect ACS to push for the squeeze-out of Hochtief's minority shareholders, similar to CIMIC in Australia, which is now 100% owned by ACS. This provides support for the valuation in the event of a sharp decline, which ACS would likely see as a buying opportunity.""Hochtief AG thus appears to be a promising investment, supported by strong market positions, growth segments, and strategic investments. For investors, this could be the right time to jump on board.Note: Start a new era of investing with InvestingPro and get access to a comprehensive set of tools to improve your investment strategy:And there's more!

The premium tier will use advanced AI for complex queries, with a subscription fee of $5 to $10 per month, separate from the $139 annual Prime membership. The paid version will offer personalized services and advanced tasks, such as writing emails and ordering from Uber Eats with a single prompt.Commenting on the news, Bank of America analysts said Alexa’s capabilities “will need to improve to stay competitive with AI advances from competitors.”Amazon has been aiming to improve Alexa's profitability for several years, with the division reportedly losing $5 billion annually in 2022. The Alexa division experienced layoffs in late 2022 and again in November 2023, when the Associated Press reported that Amazon cut ""several hundred"" employees from the unit.“While Reuters reports the division is still unprofitable, we believe an added consumer fee indicates that Amazon is committed to improving Alexa’s economics, or at least covering the cost of expanding the service offering with AI,” analysts at Bank of America said. “If Amazon does not see adoption of a paid tier, we think Amazon could cut Alexa investment further to reduce losses,” they continued.BofA estimates that there are currently around 100 million active Alexa users and if 10% subscribe to an AI-enhanced Alexa at $5 per month, it could generate an additional $600 million in revenue for AMZN.“This revenue would translate to 1.3pts of growth to our 2025 Subscription sales estimate at $49bn, and 2.6pts assuming 10% adoption of a $10/mo fee,” the bank noted.",Pos

The report claims that Eurofins has employed an excessively complex corporate structure optimized for malfeasance.The main issues highlighted in the report include related-party transactions involving real estate, complex accounting practices, including confusing cash disclosures, weak internal controls and governance, and questionable mergers and acquisitions.However, in a note published Monday in response to Eurofins Scientific's plunge, analysts at Jefferies reminded that a similarly aggressive report covering the same themes was published in 2019 by another short-selling specialist. This context suggests today's revelations might be less impactful, as the 2019 report did not result in any scandal.Nevertheless, Jefferies has maintained its ""underperform"" rating for the stock, but this is mainly due to a lack of confidence in the company's free cash flow (FCF) generation prospects, and their view of less attractive growth and margin prospects compared to larger peers.Finally, it should be noted that Jefferies has also reaffirmed its price target of 48 euros for Eurofins Scientific's stock, which is 9% lower than last Friday's close, but 12% higher than the stock price at the time of writing, given the steep decline since the Paris Stock Exchange opened.⚠️ GET 35% + 10% OFF on InvestingPro!

54,"6/24/2024, 06:18 AMUpdated 06/24/2024, 07:12 AM",Morning Bid: Transatlantic split reopens as half-year nears,"A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike DolanGlobal investors head to the half-year point this week trying to get across numerous political narratives, a hiccup in tech and a reopening of the transatlantic gap in business activity.Throw in Friday's looming release of the Federal Reserve's favoured PCE inflation gauge and an ongoing slide in Japan's yen and China's yuan and it's a sparkier summer than the buoyant first-half world markets numbers might suggest.The shakeout in artificial intelligence torchbearer Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) last week, which saw its stocks recoil about 10% from new records by the end of the week, probably owes much to profit taking on its blistering rise - and perhaps also something to do with Friday's major futures and options expiries.But with the U.S. presidential TV debate this Thursday likely to sound the starting gun on speculation around November's election outcome, the final week of the first half potentially ushers in a change of tone.Politics dominates in Europe too, with the first round of France's parliamentary election this weekend and as Britainheads to the polls on July 4.So far on Monday at least, the electoral anxiety hasn't disturbed too much in markets. European stocks pushed higher, Britain's FTSE was up and U.S. stock futures were marginally positive ahead of the bell. The VIX volatility gauge has crept to its highest of the month, however.That owes something to renewed interest rate cut hopes in Europe and in the United States - where the PCE release for May should re-emphasise that disinflation has resumed.But the latest sweep of economic and business health readings for June have showed a marked divergence again in fortunes either side of the Atlantic.Flash business surveys for the euro zone and Britain showed overall activity slowing much more than forecast this month - barely remaining in expansionary territory for June.But the equivalent U.S. soundings picked up a gear and show a much faster growth clip.ECONOMIC SURPRISE INDEX TURNS NEGATIVEAdding to the confusion, and perhaps the greater comfort that more interest rate cuts are coming in the second half, is the fact that the aggregate global economic surprise index has turned negative to the worst reading in almost a year.What's more, the hesitant business move in Europe was underlined on Monday as Germany's Ifo institute showed business morale falling unexpectedly. Ifo's business climate index sank to 88.6 in June from 89.3 in May, compared with a reading of 89.7 forecast.But the real market price action was in Japan's yen, which skidded again to within a whisker of the 160 per dollar - close to 34-year low of 160.245 it set in April before the Bank of Japan intervened to prop it up.Japan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda said on Monday authorities would take appropriate steps if there was excessive foreign exchange movement, and that the addition of Japan to the U.S. Treasury's ""monitoring list"" would not restrict their actions.Treasury last week said no major trading partner appeared to have manipulated its currency last year, but it added Japan to a foreign exchange monitoring list alongside China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore and Germany, which were on the previous list.A summary of opinions at the BOJ's June policy meeting, meantime, showed some policymakers called for raising interest rates in a timely fashion as they saw a risk of inflation overshooting expectations.Although Japan's Nikkei lapped up the weak yen and climbed 0.5%, signs of renewed foreign capital flight and rising global trade tensions saw China's ailing markets underperform yet again.The mainland CSI300 dropped 0.5% on Monday and the offshore yuan hit its weakest level of the year.In company news, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store rules breach EU tech rules because they prevent app developers from steering consumers to alternative offers, EU antitrust regulators said on Monday, a charge that could result in a hefty fine for the iPhone maker.Other big movers included Eurofins Scientific, which dropped as much as 19% after short seller Muddy Waters (NYSE:WAT) said it took a short position out on the French testing company.Britain's Prudential added 6.3% after the insurance group launched a $2 billion share buyback programme.Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Monday:* Dallas Fed June manufacturing survey * Federal Reserve Board Governor Christopher Waller speaks in Rome, San Francisco President Federal Reserve President Mary Daly speaks; Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem speaks* US Treasury auctions 3-, 6-month bills* US corporate earnings: Beyond Air (NASDAQ:XAIR), MoneyHero (By Mike Dolan, editing by Alex Richardson mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)",Neutral
55,"6/24/2024, 06:22 AMUpdated 06/24/2024, 07:12 AM",Australian wine sector a worrying case study for EU industries in China trade spat,"By Peter Hobson and Emma RumneyCANBERRA/LONDON (Reuters) - Hit with Chinese tariffs, Australia's wine industry struggled to offset the impact of falling exports despite scrambling to build new markets, source grapes from elsewhere and seek government help, industry executives said.That indicates what may be to come for food- and drink-producing sectors caught up in an EU-China trade dispute that threatens to complicate their access to the critical Chinese market.Though the EU's winemakers are not part of the current spat, its pork and brandy sectors fear they could be hit with retaliatory measures from Beijing after the bloc imposed tariffs of up to 38% on Chinese-made electric vehicles.Australian sectors faced similar curbs after the country's calls for an inquiry into the origins of COVID-19 led to Chinese import restrictions on a range of its products. The first tariffs on wine were introduced in November 2020. While most industries were able to find alternative - albeit often less profitable - markets, the Australian wine industry lost market share, key relationships and profits after China imposed tariffs of up to 218%. Famous for its cheap reds and pricier bottles from regions like the Clare and Barossa valleys, Australia was the world's fifth-largest wine exporter and China its most valuable export market. The move all but wiped out exports worth $800 million a year.While some larger players with production outside Australia, such as Treasury Wine Estates (OTC:TSRYF), fared better, Australia's wine exports in 2023 were worth 34% less than in 2019, according to Australian trade data. A key lesson for wine makers like William Dong, CEO of DMG Fine Wine, is not to rely too much on China again. ""Never make the same mistake,"" he said. ""We want to dance with China, but we don't want to go all in with them.""DMG, whose brands include Handpicked and House of Arras, tripled production from outside Australia to sell in China and increased its market share in the U.S. and southeast Asia following the tariffs, Dong said. It recouped some lost business, but its sales remained 30% lower than before 2020, he said. ""We were not as profitable as we used to be."" NO SUCCESS STORYTariffs, which were lifted this year, came at a time when the Australian wine industry faced global oversupply, falling consumption and COVID-19. While they were in place, Australian wine production shrank, stockpiles ballooned to more than two billion litres, and grape growers began destroying millions of unprofitable vines. Other industries such as barley, blocked by China in 2020, fared better at finding new markets but often had to settle for lower sale prices. Three executives and two people at industry associations said Australian wine makers resisted price cuts because they damage value long-term. Treasury Wine Estates was able to sell wines from outside Australia in China and began sourcing grapes from Chinese growers to get around tariffs. Penfolds, one of its brands popular in China, had higher net revenues in 2023 than before the tariffs. CEO Tim Ford (NYSE:F) told investors last week that the company was entering the post-tariff era as a ""stronger and more diversified global business"".Not all the strategies open to Australian winemakers can be easily adopted by EU industries under threat of tariffs. China's EU brandy imports, for example, are dominated by French cognac, which cannot be produced anywhere but the Cognac region in France.Such industries can diversify their sales. But building new markets takes time, Australian winemakers say. The industry turned to the government for help with expansion, with Canberra paying for wine marketers to help companies establish trade relationships in other nations.Bigger shipments to South Korea and Thailand helped lift the value of Australian wine exports to Asian countries outside China to $470 million in 2023 from $300 million in 2021, Australian trade data show.But overall, wine makers had mixed success in building sales, said Lee McLean, CEO of industry body Australian Grape & Wine. ""Our story is not a particularly successful one,"" he said.Companies like Taylors Wines, a family-owned winery in the Clare Valley in South Australia that used to sell a third of its exports in China under its Wakefield brand, have been forced to scale back their operations.Managing director Mitchell Taylor said wresting back lost market share will not be easy. French, Chilean and domestic wine makers expanded in China while companies like his lost trading relationships and laid off staff in the country, Taylor continued. ""If we ever get back to the level we had, it will take a long time.""",Neg

According to the investment bank, the analysis is grounded in optimistic assumptions about inflation, lower 10-year yields, and more Federal Reserve rate cuts than current consensus expectations. “That 5,500 index level is close to recent highs,” analysts at RBC noted. “While we consider our valuation model to be a compass, not a GPS, our work here nevertheless continues to make us worry that the US equity market has gotten a little ahead of itself in the short term due to a little too much optimism around interest rates and inflation after the latest CPI print/Fed meeting,” they added.Analysts at RBC pointed out that their 5,500 estimate is not their base case projection for the 2024 year-end, but rather an exercise aimed at understanding what the stock market may be pricing in currently. The note also mentions several more stress tests to gauge other economic scenarios. One scenario, which is more pessimistic, uses assumptions from the June Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) including a PCE rate of 2.6%, one rate cut, and a 10-year yield of 4.25%. This points to a fair value of 5,237 for the S&P 500.Another stress test considers no further Fed moves, stickier inflation and 10-year yields stabilizing around 4.5%, implying a fair value of 5,105. The most pessimistic scenario, which includes further rate hikes, higher-than-expected inflation (PCE above 3%), and a 10-year yield reaching 5.5%, indicates a fair value drop to between 4,600 and 4,700.",Neutral

So far, the US is on track.While recent economic strength is due to cyclical factors, unexpected immigration boosting labor supply and stronger-than-expected fiscal legislation are providing a temporary tailwind. More importantly, UBS sees signs of structurally higher growth taking root.Their analysis hinges on four supply-side megatrends: a capital spending boom, surging AI adoption, stronger business dynamism, and productivity gains. They've created a ""roar score"" to track progress on these factors.""Our conclusion is that a Roaring '20s regime is marginally more likely than it was in 4Q23,"" UBS reports. Strong household finances, increased AI investment, surging capital expenditures, and continued risk capital availability all bolster this outlook.Even though productivity growth hasn't taken off yet, disinflation progress and a potential shift to a less restrictive monetary policy by the Fed further increase the likelihood of a prosperous decade.A wildcard remains the future path of fiscal policy, with high deficits potentially requiring consolidation. However, UBS believes policy will ultimately be a headwind, not a dealbreaker.UBS believes the US economy might be slowing down, but the foundation for a ""Roaring '20s"" is being built. While not guaranteed, UBS urges investors not to underestimate this potential, drawing a parallel to the productivity boom of the late 1990s that followed an earlier period of economic slowdown.",Pos

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the quarter, we saw continued positive trends, including year-over-year price declines, improvement in vehicle value stability, and ongoing growth in upper funnel demand. We're encouraged by what we are seeing and are continuing to strengthen our business by delivering associate and customer wins that are differentiated and durable. In the first quarter, we delivered strong retail and wholesale GPUs and grew EPP margins. We sourced approximately 35,000 vehicles from dealers an all-time record. We increased used-saleable inventory units 5% year-over-year, while decreasing used total inventory units 4%. We grew CAF income 7% year-over-year under tightened lending standards and post-quarter end we launched our first non-prime securitization deal. We continued to actively manage our SG&A, and we repurchased over $100 million in shares. For the first quarter of FY ’25, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $7.1 billion, down 7% compared to last year, reflecting lower retail and wholesale volume and prices. In our retail business, total unit sales declined 3.1% and average selling price declined approximately $700 per unit or 3% year-over-year. Used unit comps were down 3.8% and we saw comp performance strengthen in the back half of the first quarter. First quarter retail gross profit per used unit was $2,347 in-line with last year's $2,361. Wholesale units sales were down 8.3% versus the first quarter last year as the industry experienced lower seasonal appreciation year-over-year. Average selling price defined approximately $900 per unit or 10%. Wholesale gross profit per unit was a first quarter record of $1,064 up from $1,042 a year ago. We bought approximately 314,000 vehicles during the quarter, down 9% from last year. The appreciation dynamics that I just mentioned impacted our overall buys as well. We purchased approximately 279,000 vehicles from consumers with slightly more than half of those buys coming through our online instant appraisal experience. With the support of our Edmund sales team, we sourced the remaining approximately 35,000 vehicles through dealers, up 70% from last year. For our first quarter online metrics, approximately 14% of retail unit sales were online consistent with last year. We continue to see ongoing adoption of our omnichannel retail experience, approximately 57% of retail unit sales were Omni sales this quarter, up from 54% in the prior year. Total revenue from online transactions was approximately 30% in-line with last year. All of our first quarter wholesale auctions and sales were virtual and are considered online transactions which represent 18% of total revenue for the quarter. CarMax Auto Finance or CAF delivered income of $147 million up 7% from the same period last year. In a few minutes, John will provide more detail on customer financing, the loan loss provision, CAF contribution, and our progress in becoming a full spectrum, full credit spectrum lender, which enables incremental growth in financing income. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our first quarter financial performance. Enrique?Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill noted, we drove strong per unit margins this quarter for both used and wholesale. We also delivered growth and other gross profit margins and CAF contributions, while staying focused on managing SG&A. First quarter net earnings per diluted share was $0.97 versus $1.44 a year ago. As a reminder, last year's quarter had a benefit of $59 million, which translates to a $0.28 per share from a legal settlements. Total gross profit was $792 million, down 3% from last year's first quarter. Used retail margin of $495 million declined by 4% with lower volume and relatively flat per unit margins. Wholesale vehicle margin of $157 million declined by 6% with lower volumes partially offset by higher per unit margins. Other gross profit was $139 million, up 3% from a year ago. This was driven by an $8 million increase in EPP. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of FY’24, we tested raising MaxCare margins per contract, which drove overall product profitability despite a lower product penetration rate. With that, we rolled out the margin increases in late Q4 FY’24. [CAF] (ph) delivered $3 million in margin, flat with last year's first quarter. Performance was primarily supported by efficiency and cost coverage measures, offset by deleverage due to lower year-over-year sales in the quarter, as well as by timing. We expect year-over-year improvement for the balance of the year as governed by sales performance given the leverage, deleverage nature of service. On the SG&A front, expenses for the first quarter were $639 million up 3% or $19 million. From the prior year's quarter, when excluding the benefit from the $59 million legal settlement received during the first quarter of FY '24. Also pressuring SG&A this quarter was approximately $22 million of expense from share based compensation for certain retirement eligible executives and the lapping of favorable reserve adjustments related to non-CAF uncollectible receivables during last year's first quarter. Excluding these items, which we noted in our FY '24 year-end call, SG&A total dollars were down year-over-year in the first quarter due to our continued discipline in spend levels. SG&A dollars for the first quarter were mainly impacted by two additional factors. First, other overhead increased by $6 million when excluding last year's favorable legal settlement. Continued year-over-year favorability in non-CAF uncollectible receivables was more than offset by lapping over last year's first quarter favorable reserve adjustment. Second, total compensation and benefits, excluding share-based compensation expense, decreased by $3 million, mostly driven by our ongoing focus on efficiency in stores and CECs. Regarding capital allocation. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares for a total spend of $104 million, which was an acceleration in the pace from the repurchase levels in the second half of fiscal year '24. As of the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.3 billion of repurchase authorization remaining. In the first quarter, we also paid off our $300 million floating rate term loan, which was scheduled to mature in early June. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jon.Jon Daniels: Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter CarMax Auto Finance originated approximately $2.3 billion, resulting in sales penetration of 43.3% net of three-day payoffs, which was up 60 basis points from last year's first quarter. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 11.4%, an increase of 30 basis points from a year ago. Partner Tier 2 penetration in the quarter was 18.7%, down from 20.4% observed last year. Partner Tier 3 volume accounted for 7.5% of sales, up from 6.7% compared to last year, as our partners improved offers were in place for the entirety of the first quarter. Both tiers saw less application volume year-over-year as lower credit customers remain challenged with affordability. Also impacting each of these year-over-year results, but to a lesser degree, is CAF's continued decreased volume in Tier 3, as well as the increased test volume in Tier 2. CAF income for the quarter was $147 million, up $10 million from the same period last year, primarily driven by an increase in total interest margin. Note, fair market value adjustments from our hedging strategy accounted for $3 million in expense this quarter versus $9 million in expense during last year's first quarter. The net interest margin percentage for the quarter was 6.2%, up from last quarter, but in-line with our expected level of near 6%. The provision for loan losses was flat to last year $81 million and resulted in a reserve balance of $493 million or 2.79% of receivables compared to 2.78% at the end of last quarter. CAF's continued investment in the Tier 2 space, offset by the previously implemented tightening in Tier 1, contributed to a consistent reserve to receivable ratio. As was highlighted last quarter, CAF has been building the capability and infrastructure to scale its participation across all credit tiers. First, CAF has leveraged its learning in Tier 2, along with its experience operating in both Tiers 1 and 3 to develop a new full-spectrum underwriting model, which we will begin to test in the second quarter. From a funding perspective, we plan to expand our current asset-backed securitization program from a single platform to one that more broadly incorporates CAF’s receivables across distinct prime and non-prime segments. We believe this will allow us to better align our offering with each investor base and ultimately generate added funding capacity. To that end, our first non-prime ABS transaction is currently in the market with $625 million of offered notes. Having the ability to both successfully decision and efficiently fund the entirety of the credit spectrum at scale puts CAF in a strategic position to further complement our full roster of lending partners, while also driving additional finance income for the business. Now I will turn the call back over to Bill.Bill Nash: Great. Thank you. As I mentioned earlier, we are encouraged by the positive trends we are seeing in pricing and vehicle value stability. I am proud of the durable actions we have been taking to support our business and further differentiate our offering, which are setting us up for continued improvements in our performance and future growth. Some examples include; we've expanded our vehicle sourcing capabilities by attracting more dealers to MaxOffer through product enhancements that make it even easier to use. We achieved record sourcing volume each month of the quarter and are excited about launching this capability in New York during the second quarter. We've increased used saleable inventory units while lowering total used inventory units through [with production] (ph) from new title management capabilities and focused inventory management in non-production stores. We have enhanced CAF’s ability to become a full spectrum lender, which positions us to further grow CAF income over time. We've raised our EPP margins and improved service gross profit. We have achieved efficiency gains in our stores and CECs that will scale very well as we buy and sell more cars. We have launched a number of EV research tools through Edmunds to help educate and build trust with consumers. We've also established test stores in California to evaluate new capabilities that support our operational readiness for increased EV sales and also enhance the customer experience. Finally, we have continued to further enhance our omni-channel capabilities we are rolling out our new order processing system to our stores and plan for it to be available nationwide later this year. The system helps associates guide customers through each step of the buying journey and provides a more seamless experience for consumers who prefer to blend self-progression with assistance from associates. In addition to these actions, we are focused on driving down cost of goods sold by pursuing incremental efficiency opportunities that we've identified across our logistics network and reconditioning operations. For logistics, we are testing a transportation management system that dispatches moves through a centralized team. The system automates communication between drivers and stores and provides new planning and execution capabilities. For reconditioning, we've identified opportunities to reduce costs such as parts acquisition, bringing elements of sublet work in-house and optimizing production workflow. In addition, we believe that balancing production capacity across our stores and stand-alone reconditioning centers, will drive further efficiencies and potentially enable us to take on more MaxCare work over time. All of these actions continue to make a stronger, better position to support consumers and fuel our excitement about our future growth in sales and profitability. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Savanna?Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.John Healy: Thank you. Bill, I'd love to just kind of start with the top of the funnel for you guys just on same-store sales. I think you mentioned that comp trends improved as we move through Q1. And would just love to get your thoughts on maybe how those improved and maybe what you're seeing now? And just as a follow-up to that, how do you answer the share question because I think that's the biggest one investors bring up is we see these numbers for CarMax, but how do you feel you guys are performing in the market versus peers? And if there is a delta, how do you explain that delta? Thanks.Bill Nash: Thank you, John. On your first question, I think what you're asking is basically kind of comp cadence. So again if you go back to the fourth quarter, we -- the last call we did halfway through the quarter, we were running mid-single-digit negative comps. Obviously the back half of the quarter was better than the first half of the quarter which we were encouraged by. And then if you look at June month to-date for the new quarter, we also continue -- we continue to see some improved performance, and we're actually running slightly positive comp June month to date. So we're encouraged to see this continued improvement there. As far as market share data, if we look at the first three calendar months of the year, which we had the title data four, we are higher in the first calendar quarter of '24 than we were in the fourth quarter of calendar 2023. We were also similar to where we were last year in the first quarter -- calendar quarter. And just to remind you, the last two fourth quarters, we've seen big price corrections. And so that's -- this one was similar. We kind of bottomed out December, we're coming back up. It looks like we are coming up about the same rate as we did last year. So year-over-year market share is fairly similar. On the market share, look there is a lot of volatility there on short periods. And barring any other big price correction, my plan is not necessarily talk about the market share again until the end of the year, because already we are seeing -- we got some markets that are up, some markets that are down. I think looking over the longer period of time is the way to really look at it. So again, I'll update this again at the end of the year unless we see some big macro factor that's having an outsized impact on it. But we feel good about the trends.John Healy: Thank you guys.Bill Nash: Thanks John.Operator: Our next question will come from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.Seth Basham: Hi, thanks a lot. And good morning. My multipart questions on cash. First, looking at the loss trends and your reserves, we continue to see losses increase in your securitized portfolio, your reserves looked a little bit light. Do you think that you're going to have to reserve more aggressively if the loss trends continue? And then secondly, how quickly can you ramp Tier 2 and Tier 3 lending, as you now have a non-prime securitization program?Jon Daniels: Yes, I appreciate the question, Seth. So with regard to losses and delinquencies within the quarter, I would say largely, we were very much in-line with what we expected for the quarter. And I think that's reflected in the provision year-over-year is basically flat. If you look at our reserved receivable ratio flat sequentially. Certainly we published data on a quarterly basis. Remember, that's roughly 60% of our portfolio. But again, the trends there are as expected -- and bear in mind, in the quarter -- this quarter is typically a high volume quarter, so your actual provision will typically be higher because you've originated more and it's typically a lower credit quality quarter because of tax time as well, so I'll add that. But for the most part, a non-event for us from a delinquency and losses as it was right in-line with our expectations. To your second question, how quickly can we ramp the Tier 2 and Tier 3 volume. I think the easier way to answer that is kind of let us anchor to what we originate today. So 43% of sales, give or take in any given point is largely what we are doing today. The vast majority clearly is in Tier 1. In Tier 3, we've been historically larger, but we are at a small piece because we are really investing in Tier 2 and trying to understand that. It is in the higher portion of Tier 2. We are really excited about our non-prime securitization program. We think that's truly going to enable growth both in the lower end of the credit spectrum for us, to take a larger percentage of sales, but also to expand what we do in the higher end in what we call our higher prime segment. So we are looking forward to that. Now as far as ramping and the timing of the ramp, I would say in the near-term, maybe for the balance of the year, we are going to continue to just learn about the Tier 2 space. We are going to roll out our new models -- sorry, test our new models in the quarter. We are going to begin to learn about the entirety of the Tier 2 spectrum. And that will take some time. And as we grow that, we will certainly let folks know. But beyond that, we do think there is room for us to grow beyond 43%. Will it be 45%, 47%, 50%, remains to be seen the timing of how much and when, but we do believe it is substantial, but probably not doing much more than what we're doing today for the balance of the year.Enrique Mayor-Mora: I do think longer term as well, when you assess when you think about funding capacity, do you think us entering into this market, which we are really excited about, it is probably another $2 billion to $3 billion worth of funding capacity that we are going to give ourselves when you think about how deep we can eventually go over time. So this is a really exciting program, and we expect to drive our financing income incrementally moving forward.Seth Basham: Absolutely. Thank you.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Bellinger with Mizuho.David Bellinger: Hi, great. Thanks for taking my question. It's on the expense side. So if you look at the ad spend per total unit, I think that was up about 5% year-over-year compares to your guidance for flattish. Maybe just walk us through any changes you are seeing there on the ad spend line. And just overall, how we should think about SG&A dollars in Q2 and over the balance of the year?Enrique Mayor-Mora: Thanks for the question. I would tell you that's pretty benign, right? I think quarter-to-quarter, it's going to be plus here, a little bit negative here on the total unit basis, which is again, how we manage our total advertising spend. So I wouldn't look at that as anything other than just kind of quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, but we are committed to managing to add roughly $200 per total unit for the balance of the year -- for the entire year, I should say.Bill Nash: SG&A on the rest of the year.Enrique Mayor-Mora: For the rest of the year -- sorry, can you repeat the question again?David Bellinger: Yes. And just the second part is overall SG&A expense dollars. Just how should we think about that level through the balance of the year?Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yes. I think for the entire year, we are really focused in the first quarter, we are really proud of the fact that once you back out some of the noise that I spoke to, we were actually down SG&A year-over-year. I’d expect that for the balance of the year, that is going to be a little bit more challenging from a total dollar standpoint, but what I'll reemphasize here is what we are focused on. And what we're focused on is putting ourselves in a position through active cost management to be able to lever on low single-digit gross profit growth. And that's really what we're focused on. And so when you look at where we've been for the past several years in our heavy investment phase, that is a different story, right? And it really speaks to us migrating more to a little bit more of a fixed cost structure and an ability to lever when sales roll around which they will. And so that's how we think about our ability to leverage moving forward.David Bellinger: Got it. Thank you.Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.Brian Nagel: Hi, good morning.Bill Nash: Good morning.Brian Nagel: A couple of questions. I'll lump them together. The first, just with regard to the -- this first non-prime securitization. I think it's a follow-up to Seth's question before. But as we think about this development, I mean, how -- what are the ramifications, longer term for CarMax. Is this going to be a potential vehicle to drive better share, better profitability, both. I mean again, how should we think about the model [question] (ph) now with this capability? And then my second question, unrelated. You keep calling out the sourcing vehicles from dealers. I guess the question is the sustainability of that and just also the potential positives for margins or other sourcing. Thanks.Jon Daniels: Thank you, Brian. I appreciate the question. I'll take the first one with regard to the non-prime securitization. Yes, I'm going to continue to anchor us to this kind of 43% of sales, as mentioned, we think there is some substantive volume that we can take above that. And the best way to kind of give orders of magnitude of the value, the long-term value here is we see it under the current financial situation, the current economics for every one point of sales that we can grab we think that can drive $10 million to $12 million worth of value to CarMax. Now bear in mind, that doesn't start day one when you begin to add that volume. Initially, you originate additional volume, you need to provision for loan losses, but eventually it becomes accretive. And once you get to steady state, that's where I'm referring to the $10 million to $12 million. So as you can imagine, as you tackle on additional points, you tackle on additional value for CarMax. And in the long run, we think it is very substantial and something we are looking forward to going after.Bill Nash: Yes. And as far as the second part of your question, Brian, on dealer sourcing, look we're all about sourcing vehicles wherever we can find them. And traditionally, for us we've been sourcing them through consumers. And then what we don't get from consumers we've been buying it off-site auctions. This is just another step to diversify. We buy consumers. We can buy directly from dealers. And the ones that we're buying for dealers, the bulk of the -- it's a little different that we bought to consumers. The majority of those are -- there's a higher percentage of retail cars that we're buying from dealers. So while they are not as profitable as the ones we bought from consumers, they're certainly more profitable than one we have to go off-site for. So we are encouraged by it. We think it's -- this is an area that we can continue to grow. We're getting great responses from the dealers. We've made some improvements to the platform, which I think is part of why you are seeing this continued demand. And if I look at a year ago versus now, we've -- the dealers that are actively using it have bumped up, let's call it, roughly 50% in the last year, and we really haven't added -- I mean, we added a few more markets, but really haven't added that many more markets. So we're encouraged by it.Brian Nagel: Thanks guys. Appreciate the color.Operator: Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.Sharon Zackfia: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess it's kind of on the improvement in sales you've been seeing. I mean do you think that broader industry dynamics, do you think there's something operationally you are doing I know obviously, at the top of the funnel is increasing conversion has been down a little bit. Is that starting to improve for you? And if so, kind of where and why? Thanks.Bill Nash: Yes. Thank you for the question, Sharon. Look, I think it is a combination of things. I think it reflects on just some of the continued work that we are doing internally, but it's also look vehicle prices, even though they were up quarter-over-quarter, they're always up from the fourth to the first, they were down $700 year-over-year. So we are seeing vehicle values be a little bit more stable. If you look at depreciation trends, for example, -- if you look at the last two years, they're all over the board from appreciation to depreciation and they are steep both ways. This year is a little bit more what I’d call normal, although there is a difference in the first quarter last year, just to expand on some of my comments earlier. Last year, we saw appreciation kind of in this first time period of the year of about $2,500. And then we saw about $1,100 depreciation this year. We only went up about $1,000 and then kind of flat by the end of the quarter. So you have a little bit of year-over-year dynamics. But again just the value stability that's nice. I mean we've always worked in an environment where there is been appreciation, depreciation, what's more impacted us the last 1.5 years, 2 years is these big price corrections. So I think it is a combination of factors.Operator: And we will take our next question from Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Rajat Gupta: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Bill, I just had a question on strategy and operations. I think like you can all see like the factual data on the unit comps, in the market share. It's not where CarMax used to be historically. And if you look at your margins and like the EBITDA per unit, as you exclude the one-time items this quarter, they have not changed or improved. So I'm curious if you think the current strategy that you have around sourcing, the impact omni-channel has had on your in-store culture? Is all of that still the right approach. Or do you think something needs to change? Or are we just waiting for the industry backdrop to improve for CarMax to do better on all these metrics, especially when some of the public peers are doing better? Thanks.Bill Nash: Yes, Rajat. Look I feel great about the strategy. I feel great about all the things that you talked about. I think what's really been the story for us particularly is really what you've seen over the last 1.5 years, and it's been more about these big price corrections. And what's going on in the market, the fact that we sell a late model, high-quality car from an affordability standpoint. So if you look at the data, you are seeing more 10-plus year old cars being sold here in the last two years. I think that's even the same case for the first calendar quarter. So I think the impact on the business have been more macro related, but we certainly have not been sitting here waiting for them to get better. We've been making ourselves stronger. And I think those dividends will continue to come back. They'll pay dividends as we go forward as sales come back. I mean keep in mind, last year I think the total used cars exchange was $35.5 million. It is typically north of $40 million. And the most impacted share of that group is the less than six year old. And again, it goes back to the affordability. So we feel great about our strategy. We feel great about the durable actions I told you that we've taken, which will continue to give us benefits as we go forward.Enrique Mayor-Mora: Yeah. I do think it's important to point out as well, and Bill talked about it in his prepared remarks. Going after aggressively going after reconditioning costs, going after logistics costs and bringing those down. Those are material items moving forward that we anticipate that can support sales that can support margin, both of those items. So we're excited about those. So Rajat, it is a matter of aggressive also going after what we can control, and we can control that.Bill Nash: The only other thing I would add to that, Rajat is when you go through experiences like this, you want to be a better, stronger company. So if this was to happen again in the future, what might you do different. And some of the things we've already talked about, the -- expanding our sourcing, Enrique just talked about really focusing on the cost of goods sold. Jon has talked about the financing. I actually think the financing, not only is it going to allow us to grow CAF income, I think there is an opportunity to actually grow units because I think there's little pockets that maybe our partners aren't picking up that we think are actually good little pockets that we can now do. I think the work that we've done on the variable cost for example. A lot of those factors, the EPP, the increase net, all those factors also enter into the equation on elasticity when it comes to measuring like should we lower prices, should we keep the prices the same. So again, I think we've learned a lot. We've made a lot of improvements. So if the situation has to happen together, we have more tools in our tool chest.Rajat Gupta: Maybe just like on the June commentary, I mean is it fair to expect that the positive trends you're seeing should only get better through the course of the quarter? Or is there some monthly seasonality or comps to keep in mind there? Thanks.Bill Nash: No, look, we are encouraged by the -- really the trend since the second half of the first quarter. Like I said, it is even continued into June. So we are encouraged by that, and we are going to keep getting after it. So I don't have a crystal ball to tell you exactly what's going to happen this year, but we feel good about the trajectory.Rajat Gupta: Great. Thank you.Bill Nash: Thank you.Operator: Our next question will come from Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead.Craig Kennison: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Bill, you mentioned some cost of goods sold initiatives related to logistics and reconditioning. Do you expect those savings to flow through to the bottom-line or to drive lower prices? And then is there any way for you to quantify the per unit impact of those initiatives?Bill Nash: Yes. Great questions, Craig. And yes, we are -- from a quantification standpoint, look I think we have a couple of hundred bucks per unit per retail unit that we are going after over the next year or two between reconditioning and logistics. So as you know, that's not insignificant at all. And we are excited about it. It is not going to hit day one tomorrow. But across the two, we feel like there is kind of that amount of opportunity there. And then the other part of your question.Craig Kennison: Do you expect that to hit the bottom-line? Or is that something --.Bill Nash: Yes. So what I would tell you is, I mean, obviously, you have a decision to make when you start to pull that in. As I sit here right now, I'd say look, we'd probably flow that through in the form of pricing. But certainly you have decisions to make as you realize some of those efficiencies.Craig Kennison: Why -- I guess just a follow up, why not take if your prices are competitive today, why not take those efficiencies to the bottom-line.Bill Nash: Well, again, you have decisions to make. And again we will be looking at the affordability. We'll be looking at elasticity. There's lots of – it is hard for me to say what the situation is going to look like once we get there because there is a lot of factors that play into that. We may take some of it. We may take -- in the past, I mean, you've followed us long enough, at one point when we picked up some reconditioning savings, we took them to the bottom-line. But a lot of the years since then, we've been passing along and it helps us just manage overall margin that helps manage the price. So I just think there is a lot that goes into the equation that we'll have to look at that point in time.Craig Kennison: Yeah, make sense Bill. Thank you.Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY). Please go ahead.Chris Bottiglieri: So first, I just wanted to follow up that last question actually. Can you elaborate more on the parts acquisition? That sounds pretty material. Are you going direct to vendor and is sourcing yourself? Or are you asking your retail partners to reduce pricing. And then I have a question on credit. I know I'm breaking David’s rule, I apologize. I hope I'm not doing intentionally, sorry. But the prospectus on new non-prime securitization would suggest there is $5 billion of this type of receivable. How does that $5 billion legacy portfolio that's behind that securization, how does that differ between Tier 2? Like is Tier 2 just like a higher CNL than the legacy 5? Can you just elaborate like how this is different and [where is this going] (ph)? Thanks.Bill Nash: Sure, Chris. Well, first of all, breaking Davi’s Rule, you're the only one that apologize and everybody has broken it up to this point. So we forgive you. The first part of the question I'll answer, and I'll pass it over to Jon on the [non-prime] (ph). So look, we've got unbelievable part partners. Parts partners have been around for a long time. So where we have national relationships with. So that's been great. We just see that there's some parts optimization internally that we can do better on and which parts we are getting from which source and which parts are being applied and not being applied. So that's just one of many things that we're working on. But I don't want you to come away. I think we had this we don't have good partners or whatever because we do, we have great national relationships, and we're pleased with those partners. We just think we can do a better job optimizing the parts so. Jon?Jon Daniels: Yes. I appreciate the question, Chris. So if we think about the legacy $5 billion you referred to, if I look at kind of our overall portfolio or what we originate across our 43% again, we've historically operated our current program. The vast majority of that has been Tier 1 that we are putting into the current ABS program. If we think about that -- those receivables, we are going to basically split that and we are going to create a higher prime program, which is going to target, again we think a different investor base, really give us scale across what we would consider the higher portion of those historically securitized receivables. And then we dropped down the residual there, including -- and then add to that, the Tier 2 and the Tier 3 volume that we have not historically securitized, will be able to be lumped together into this non-prime program. So that's how you think about what we originate today. If you think about what we might go after in the future, there are small pockets of Tier 1 that we've tightened in today that we would be able to capture back, and we are always looking to do that. But then if you look at the entirety of Tier 2 and Tier 3, call that today, it is 27% of sales. That is a wide spectrum in all honesty, across that 27%. And so we think that there is volume being captured across all of that, and we will figure out what the right spot to be in is. So -- but again, this will enable us to grow down there. Now the last thing I'd want to make a point on is our partners have enjoyed that volume, and we love that they enjoy that volume. We anticipate selling a lot of cars in the future, and we want our partners right there with us along for the ride. So we will go after some of that volume in the -- in that Tier 2 and that Tier 3 space. We don't want it all, but we do think there is opportunity to grow there. So hopefully, that broad answers your question.Enrique Mayor-Mora: I would just add said one thing, Chris. I think a general way to think about that split in the program between high prime and non-prime from a FICO perspective, I think of the non-prime is less than [$650 million] (ph) and then the high prime is greater than [$650 million] (ph), just a general way to think about the two pools.Chris Bottiglieri: Gotcha. Okay. Thank you for all the help. Appreciate it.Operator: Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please go ahead.Scot Ciccarelli: Good morning guys. Bill, I know you've had a couple of different questions on market share, but I'm going to try to swing out a little bit differently here. From the outside, I guess, we can see growth rates of Carvana and the public dealers -- given your commentary earlier on mix, do you think it is your mix of late-model product, that's kind of the key driver to the relative growth rates that we are seeing? Or could there be other factors at play, whether it is credit approvals or something else?Bill Nash: No, Scott. I think the biggest factor is really coming off that big price correction at the end of the calendar year last year. Remember, we hold our margins obviously, it is a highly fragmented market. There is lots of folks that don't hold their margins. They are getting rid of the inventory. So I think that's been a big factor most recently in the drop in the fourth quarter and now as we are starting to climb back out. But certainly, I think beyond that -- look as I said earlier, I think there's more cars that are being sold, for example that are 10 years and older, and that is just not a space that we really do anything. And I think the other thing is our bread and butter has always been kind of 0 to 4. That's probably 70% of historically what our sales are. And that's been an expensive ticket for folks. And so there -- we've seen people migrate down. We've seen like throughout the last couple of years, when you look at credit apps, people are looking for a little bit cheaper car, and that's across all the credit spectrum. So I think, there is a combination of things that are going on. And the other thing is we are just not going to -- we've spent 30 years making sure that we have a high-quality product, and we want to maintain that high-quality product. And so we understand that there is going to be some consumers that have traded down. So I think it is a combination of things.Scot Ciccarelli: Okay. Can I ask a follow-up. Where is -- when you look across your markets, I know historically the older management team used to refer to kind of 10% market share in certain markets like -- what is your highest market share in a specific market, just so we can kind of compare the 4% average to it?Bill Nash: Yes. So we're -- our highest markets are over 10% still. And when we -- and I've talked about this in the past, when we rolled out on the originally in '20. We looked at those 15 oldest markets. And we actually saw a nice little acceleration in market share. Obviously, they grow a lot slower than the younger stores. But I don't know where the top end of that is, but it is the older ones, they're over double digits, over 10%.Scot Ciccarelli: Got it. Thanks guys.Bill Nash: Thank you Scott.Operator: Our next question will come from Chris Pierce with Needham. Please go ahead.Chris Pierce: Can you talk about supply? I know we are seeing commercial vehicles at auction kind of grow year-over-year with more growth ahead. But is that the supply of cars that you need to come back that will help the overall share of newer cars in the market, gain share versus older share -- older cars and that helps you sort of gain share? Like what are you seeing from a supply perspective?Bill Nash: Yes -- and a lot has been written and folks saying that we have a supply problem. And the reality is we are not having a problem sourcing the cars. If there is any impact on supply or from supply, it's just that it goes into the overall affordability question, but we can get to supply. Now having said that, I think it's great that the SAAR continues to go up. I think the most recent number I saw was like [15.7%] (ph) eventually, and we've already started to see it, to your point more cars that come into the market, again help bring the price down of the used cars and more specifically, 0 to 4. So I think it is more inventory owners. And I think that is good for the industry. I think it is good for us.Chris Pierce: Okay. So just -- you're not having problems getting supply, but you're choosing not to source older vehicles, and that's what's sort of hurting the share, but I just want to make sure I'm kind of understanding where supply is going and the supply decisions you are making?Bill Nash: Yes. So no, I appreciate the clarification because when you asked the question, you were talking more about the supply of I thought later-model cars. If there is any supply issue, it's just if you're looking for an older vehicle, for us we buy lots of older vehicles, but there is only so many of them that you can bring up to the quality standards. So if we have any supply issue at all, it would be more in the older vehicles that meet the CarMax standards. But again, I mean, we've had roughly one-third of our cars are, let's call it, more than six years old. That is quite up -- it's up a lot from where it was before. But if there's any supply, you'd probably be more in that bucket versus the late model bucket.Chris Pierce: So just -- is the supply of vehicles that meet the CarMax standard growing? Or has it been flat not changing -- what's the right way to think about the supply vehicle that you're going to retail?Bill Nash: Yes, I think as we look forward, you look holistically, whether it is an older CarMax vehicle that meets our parameters or younger one, I think the supply is improving just because of with the dynamic that you talked about earlier because the SAAR is continuing to go up, eventually, those cars come in. So and the impact has on us as well prices just start to come down. And I think that's good for the industry, and it's good for us.Chris Pierce: Okay, thank you for that. I appreciate.Bill Nash: Thank you Chris.Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from David Bellinger with Mizuho. Please go ahead.David Bellinger: Hi thanks guys. Just another one. Regarding the CDK and the dealer software issues that are pretty widespread right now, does CarMax have any exposure there? Are you seeing any changes in volumes or consumer activity? Just any clarity you can provide on just some of the near-term implications from this widespread issue?Bill Nash: Yes. it's unfortunate for those dealers because I know there are a lot of them. We do not use CDK as our DMS. It has a small impact on us and the way it has an impact on us is -- we obviously work with a lot of other dealers from a parts standpoint. And if their systems are down, it can slow down parts, there is a little impact on title work as well. But I would say it's just minor in the scheme of things as far as the impact on us.David Bellinger: Got it. Thank you.Operator: I'll hand the call back to Bill for any closing remarks.Bill Nash: Okay. Great. Well, I want to thank -- as always, Jon, I thank all of our associates for everything they do. I also want to thank you all for joining the call today. And just let you know, we just recently published the 2024 responsibility report, and I would encourage all of you to read it. It provides great updates on several of our key initiatives from climate related to the tangible impact we're making on our local communities. I think we're proud. I think it demonstrates our values and how we live. And it also positions us well to drive long-term sustainable value for all of our shareholders. So again, we appreciate your time today and we'll talk again next quarter.Operator: And this will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C.",Neutral

Volume growth across all four of our major product categories for the year, as well as resilient pricing in wallboard and continued inflation in ceilings and complementary products, helped drive a record $5.5 billion in net sales and $5.3 billion in organic sales for the full year fiscal 2024. Benefiting from our balanced end markets, continuing demand in multifamily and solid levels of commercial activity helped to offset a more challenging single-family backdrop as compared with the year before. Looking at just our fourth quarter results, considering the significant steel pricing and associated margin headwinds, which accelerated, particularly late in the quarter, we closed out fiscal 2024 with another solid level of performance, including generating net sales of $1.4 billion, net income of $56.4 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $146.6 million. Cash flow generation was strong with $204.2 million of cash from operating activities and $186.7 million of free cash flow. As with our full year results, we delivered fourth quarter volume across all four of our major product categories, albeit at a much slower rate for steel in April than expected, particularly for multifamily applications. Single-family, however, began to trend favorably, and for the first time since the fall of 2022, wallboard volumes for this sector were up year-over-year for the quarter. And although our fourth quarter average wallboard price was down slightly year-over-year, mostly due to mix, prices were flat sequentially, and in the coming months, we expect to benefit from implementation of the previously announced manufacturer pricing actions, consistent with the typical three to six month lag we traditionally see for wallboard price realization. As we move into fiscal 2025, we believe we are prepared for what we expect to be an environment of changing end market dynamics once again. First, although temporarily hindered by the current mortgage rate environment and record-high home prices, significant pent-up demand remains for single-family housing, which provides confidence for the medium to long term. Through April, single-family starts were up almost 26% calendar year to date as compared with a year ago. Therefore, we expect to see continued moderate year-over-year improvement for this end market in the near term, followed by a more robust recovery thereafter with what we expect will be an eventual downward shift in interest rates. For multifamily, the demand environment was exceptionally strong for fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior year. However, given the significant decline in starts last year, this end market has likely peaked and we believe it will flat however as we serve the remaining backlog over the next quarter or so before we see a notable decline in activity levels during the back half of our fiscal year. At approximately 15% of our sales, we expect that the pace of declines will be manageable, particularly given the expectation for offsetting demand improvement in single-family construction. Finally, commercial construction activity remained solid during fiscal 2024 with a number of mega projects underway as well as still attractive demand in certain subsectors, primarily data centers, reshoring-related and stimulus-driven projects, education and healthcare. However, with put in place spending flattening and new commercial starts declining, financing availability and cost, coupled with labor constraints and other inflationary pressures appear to be headwinds broadly. In this environment, we would expect a mixed demand profile by sector as some commercial applications will likely be pressured while others still have favorable support. As an indication of this varied environment, steel framing demand softened late in the fourth quarter, more than we had previously anticipated, both in terms of volume and price. However, more recently, most of the leading steel framing manufacturers have announced price increases, positive indicators for at least a flattening of recent deflationary pressures in the coming quarters. This dynamic backdrop of end markets brings to light the benefits of our balanced customer base with a revenue mix that is today roughly 50-50 commercial and residential. While still constrained in the near term, we believe that improvements in single-family construction will help to offset the challenges facing the multifamily and commercial end markets, and all of these markets will ultimately benefit from relief in financing rates and availability when that occurs, I would like to thank the entire GMS team for their continued commitment to delivering outstanding service and adding value for our customers. Through their efforts, we continue to flex our operations to successfully navigate the changing tides of customer demand. Turning now to Slide 4, I'm very pleased to highlight that GMS continues to improve as we grow and fiscal 2024 was another year of progress as our team executed with focus against our strategic pillars. We successfully expanded our share of U.S. wallboard sales by close to 80 basis points during the year when comparing our shipments to those reported by the gypsum manufacturers for the 12 months ended March 31, 2024, the closest proxy we have to our fiscal year. Likewise, in steel, for that same time period, we gained approximately 130 basis points of share as reported by the Steel Framing Industry Association. And based upon available public disclosures from ceilings manufacturers, our share grew in this product space again in fiscal 2024 in total, and particularly in the higher-end architectural specialties products. Our service model, commitment to job site safety, and our expertise in every end market we serve, as well as our intentional effort to deepen our customer relationships and use technology to be faster and easier to work with, all contributed to our success this year. Our complementary products grew this past year by 7.4%, and in our key areas of focus, EIFS and Stucco, tools and fasteners and insulation, we grew 11.5%. These outstanding results are due in many respects to those same things driving our core share, but are also due to our expanded sales organization, center-led purchasing programs and the synergistic leveraging of acquired company expertise across the legacy business. While the newly acquired businesses benefit from GMS' systems and scale, we remain committed to both organic and acquisitive growth in the strategically critical complementary product space. M&A has been and continues to be a key strategic driver of our growth. This past year was no exception as we acquired Home Lumber & Building Supplies, which expanded our presence in complementary product offerings in Western Canada. AMW Construction Supply, which expanded our complementary tools and fasteners in Phoenix, Arizona and Kamco Supply Corporation, which provided us with one of the leading market positions in New York City, the largest MSA, where we lacked a significant presence prior to this transaction. Also, subsequent to the end of our fiscal year, we announced a smaller acquisition of Howard & Sons to supplement our operations in Southern California and our agreement to purchase Yvon Building Supplies and other affiliated companies in Ontario, Canada, which we expect to close next month. We look forward to being able to welcome the Yvon team and adding their seven locations to our portfolio to better serve the Ontario market. Our current Canadian operations generated approximately 13% of our total net sales during fiscal 2024, and of that, more than half of those sales were in complementary products, which tend to be margin accretive to the overall business. In addition to our more traditional acquisition targets in the United States, with substantial white space still available for us in Canada, we expect to continue to pursue additional margin-enhancing opportunities like the pending Yvon transaction. Our Yard of the Future initiatives also took steps forward during fiscal 2024. For example, we have now completed the installation of yard-wide Wi-Fi and added tablets in the 85% of our yards we're doing so make sense. With varying degrees of adoption so far, now that we have all of the tools in place, fiscal year '25 will be the year of further operational progression of this paperless picking and loading technology. Where we have completed the necessary entity and data consolidations, we have simplified our back-of-house teams and processes and are working to implement more advanced ERP-embedded purchasing capabilities. We've seen improved service and inventory momentum as a result, which contributed to the free cash flow success we achieved in both our fiscal fourth quarter and the full year. We expect to complete our entity consolidation and the associated process, organization and data simplification of our various divisions by the end of calendar 2025 and expect to see cost and productivity benefits as we continue these efforts. And finally, we are making progress as we promote the value of our direct e-commerce platform to our customers. While adoption continues to evolve, we are seeing usage increase in many areas. For example, more than 70% of our customers have created online accounts by fiscal year end 2024, and as such, we have seen increases in web orders and activity. Importantly, as of the end of fiscal 2024, the percentage of payments we are receiving through our integrated online customer portal is now approaching 20% each month, making it easier for our customers and saving the company both time and money. Collectively, all of the productivity initiatives we have underway are intended to help preserve and drive additional profits and make it easier to do business with us. We continue to become better operators and reducing complexity in the business with the objective of providing greater value to all of our stakeholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Scott.Scott Deakin: Thank you, JT, and good morning everyone. Starting with Slide 5, net sales for our fiscal fourth quarter increased 8.4% or 6.7% on a per-day basis, to $1.4 billion as volume growth across our major product categories helped to offset price deflation, notably including an estimated $29 million for steel, assuming current year volumes have been sold at prior year prices. Commercial and multifamily activity levels remained solid for the quarter, while single-family turned the corner with positive year-over-year growth in demand. Our recent acquisitions such as Kamco, EMJ and AMW also contributed positively to our quarter's top line results. Organically, consolidated sales grew 4% or 2.4% on a same-day basis compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. From a U.S. end market perspective, commercial sales dollars grew 6% year-over-year on a per day basis despite continued and greater than expected steel price deflation. Single-family sales showed marked improvement in with the year-over-year comparison turning positive for the first time since the fall of calendar 2022, with 2.8% growth per day as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Multifamily activity also remains solid, particularly in wallboard, but a little slower overall than we had anticipated, principally on steel volumes with 2.4% growth per day in sales dollars as compared to the robust fourth quarter a year ago. Wallboard sales dollars of $586 million were up 7.6% over the same period last year, or 5.9% on a per day basis, with multifamily volumes up 5.4% and commercial volumes up 8.7%. As expected, single-family volumes also turned positive for the first time since the quarter of fiscal 2023, with wallboard volume growth per day of 7.6% as compared with the fourth quarter last year. Organically, fourth quarter wallboard sales were up 6% compared with the prior year period, or 4.3% on a per day basis, comprised of a 6.3% increase in volume, partially offset by a 1.9% decline in price and mix as single-family board comprised a greater portion of our sales this quarter. As expected, given the various supply-side dynamics, wallboard pricing remained resilient throughout calendar year 2023 despite the year-over-year slowdown in the single-family market. For our fiscal fourth quarter, the average realized wallboard price of $475 per thousand square feet was up slightly from the third quarter but down 1.3% from the same period a year ago, as the outperformance in single-family wallboard volumes led to a greater mix shift towards the less expensive board used in that end markets construction. Moreover, as we said in past quarters, we would typically expect a lag between announced manufacturer price increases and our realization of those prices in the market. As such, our teams are still in the process of implementing the increases announced earlier this calendar year. Therefore, while we expect to see some of those pricing benefits late in our fiscal first quarter, we also expect continued mix shifts, which combined will likely result in wallboard pricing remaining roughly flat year-over-year for us for the next several quarters. Longer term, the minimal capacity additions being made by the wallboard manufacturing space are expected to do little to alleviate the tight conditions we expect once single-family demand gains some momentum, which together with higher operating and raw material cost increases, particularly in gypsum, should help drive further pricing improvements. Ceiling sales of $188.9 million in the fourth quarter were up 21.7%, or 19.8% on a per day basis, with strong increases of 11.4% in volume and 8.4% in price and mix. Organic sales in ceilings grew 11.4%, or 9.7% on a per day basis, with a 5.5% increase in volume and a 4.2% increase in price and mix. Fourth quarter steel framing sales of $220.5 million were down 1.5% or 3% on a same day basis versus the prior year quarter as deflationary pricing drove an 11.8% decline in price and mix while volumes increased 8.8%, still healthy but below our expectations due to slower multifamily conditions in certain markets, particularly late in the quarter. Organically, steel framing sales were down 6.6% on a same day basis, with a 13.5% decline in price and mix, partially offset by a 6.9% increase in volume. Until we see some real recovery in either the office or other commercial remodeling space, steel volumes will likely continue to be less predictable as larger projects and a higher mix of end-market applications are driving a greater portion of our commercial activity than has been true historically. Broadly speaking, prices for steel framing retreated farther and for longer than we would have expected. For the fourth quarter, prices for steel framing products were down 11.7% compared to a year ago but were roughly flat on a sequential basis. And although we have received multiple price increase notices from the formers, it will take some time to realize any potential acceptance by the market. As a result, we expect monthly steel framing prices to soften sequentially through the remainder of Q1 at least slightly before flattening at or around the quarter end levels in subsequent quarters. Complementary product sales of $417.6 million for the quarter grew 9.8% year-over-year in total and 3.5% on an organic basis, representing the 16th consecutive quarter of growth for this category. On a per day basis, complementary product growth was 8% for total sales and 1.9% for organic sales. Expansion of complementary products, particularly for tools and fasteners, EIFS and Stucco, and insulation, continues to be a key element of our strategic priority as those categories grew 10.4% for the quarter. Now turning to Slide 6, which highlights our profitability for the quarter. Gross profit of $451.2 million increased 6.3% compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to the favorable impact of our recent acquisitions and the improved volumes we delivered during the quarter across all of our major product lines, partially offset by deflationary dynamics in steel pricing. Gross margin of 31.9% was down 60 basis points as compared to 32.5% a year ago, primarily related to steel price deflation partially offset by favorable volume-driven incentives. Cost of sales for the quarter also included the negative $1.2 million impact of non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, primarily related to Kamco, to increase acquired inventory to its estimated fair value. These adjustments were $0.5 million a year ago. Absent these adjustments, gross margin would have been 32% for our fiscal fourth quarter. Together with the traditional price implementation lag, competitive dynamics and mix also dampened fourth quarter gross margins as compared with our prior expectations for the quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $315.5 million for the quarter, an increase of $35.8 million over the prior year quarter, primarily related to our recent acquisitions in greenfield openings. Also contributing to the higher SG&A expenses were increased labor costs, unfavorable volumes, coupled with some inflationary pressures in wages and benefits. Relative to our expectations going into the fourth quarter, SG&A also included a $2 million reserve for bad debt expense. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 22.3%, an increase of 80 basis points for the quarter of fiscal 2023, with 55 basis points of the leveraged change attributable to reduced revenue as a result of product price deflation. Increased wages, benefits and other costs resulting mostly from improved volumes as well as some inflationary pressure in these costs negatively impacted SG&A leverage by an estimated 15 basis points. Approximately 10 basis points of the remaining variance was primarily due to our recent acquisitions and greenfield yard openings. Adjusted SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales of 21.8% increased 90 basis points from 20.9% in the prior year quarter. All in, inclusive of a 4.6% increase in interest expense and a 17.1% increase in income tax expense, net income decreased 25.4% to $56.4 million for the quarter, or $1.39 per diluted share compared to net income of $75.6 million, or $1.80 per diluted share a year ago. State taxes were higher in the quarter, primarily the result of acquisitions that resulted in an increase in apportionment to higher tax jurisdictions, together with a one-time revaluation of the company's deferred tax liability. Also contributing to the decrease in net income was an increase in depreciation expense and a write-off of debt discount and deferred financing fees in connection with our term loan refinancing. Over the longer term, this refinancing is expected to benefit net income by approximately $2.6 million per year until the loan's expiration in May of 2030. For the full year of 2025, we expect our tax rate to be consistent with that of FY '24. Adjusted EBITDA of $146.6 million decreased 5% or $7.8 million as compared with a year ago, and adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 10.4% compared to last year's fourth quarter level of 11.8%. Now, shifting to our balance sheet, which is highlighted on Slide 7. At April 30, we had cash on hand of $166.1 million and $655.9 million of available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities. We had no near-term debt maturities and our net adjusted EBITDA debt leverage at the end of the quarter was 1.7 times better than indicated following the Kamco transaction. Last year's leverage at the end of the fourth quarter for fiscal 2023 was 1.4 times. As JT mentioned, subsequent to the end of our fiscal fourth quarter, we entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the stock of Yvon supply company and affiliates for a purchase price of up to CAD196.5 million, or about USD143 million. With more than a quarter of the purchase price to be paid over the next five years, the transaction value is consistent with our track record of acquiring at or near GMS' market multiple. For the 12 months ended February 29, 2024, Yvon generated net revenues in excess of CAD190 million, which is just under USD140 million at current exchange rates. This transaction, which we expect to close next month, is expected to be slightly margin accretive in line with our broader Canadian operations. We expect to fund this transaction with cash on hand and from borrowings under our ADL, which we expect would all else being equal, initially raise our net debt leverage ratio to just over 2 times adjusted EBITDA with an expected one-half turn improvement over the course of FY '25. Our team generated significant cash flow as we traditionally do during the fourth quarter. Cash provided by operating activities was $204.2 million for our fiscal fourth quarter compared to $204.8 million a year ago. Free cash flow was $186.7 million compared to $185.4 million for the same period last year. Free cash flow for the quarter totaled 127.4% of adjusted EBITDA. For the full year, we generated cash provided by operating activities of $433.2 million and free cash flow of $376 million, representing 61.1% of adjusted EBITDA, exceeding our expectations. Capital expenditures of $17.5 million for the quarter compared to $19.4 million a year ago. For the full year fiscal 2025, we expect capital expenditures to total between $50 million and $55 million. We repurchased another 174,600 shares of stock during the quarter for $16 million and had $200.5 million of share repurchase authorization remaining at April 30. Looking forward, we expect to continue our balanced approach of capital allocation with continued investment in our business and attractive M&A opportunities, while also seeking to opportunistically return value to our shareholders through our share buyback program. We have a solid balance sheet with no near term maturities and an attractive capital structure providing an effective foundation for the continued execution of our strategic priorities. Before turning the call over to JT, I have just a couple of housekeeping items. First, we will have an equal number of selling days per quarter year-over-year for our first three quarters of fiscal 2025. In our fiscal fourth quarter, we will have 63 days compared with 64 in the prior year period. And second, the projections that JT will provide exclude any benefit we expect to get from Yvon after that transaction closes in the last month of our quarter. With that, I'll now turn the call over to JT. He'll start on Slide 8.John Turner: Thank you, Scott. We are pleased with the results we delivered for fiscal 2024 and believe that despite some short-term pressures in our end markets, we are well positioned to pivot as needed to address any shifts in end market demand and economics as we move throughout fiscal 2025. The resilience we saw in wallboard pricing during fiscal 2024 continued to prove out the new realities of the wallboard industry, including tight capacity with few newer planned additions expected in the near term, coupled with rising manufacturing costs, notably including those driven by the declining availability of synthetic gypsum, primarily in the Eastern U.S. After a slow year for single-family activity with an undersupply of new and existing homes on the market, we've seen some improving trends, but anticipate a more substantial recovery to be tied to lower mortgage rates over time. Meanwhile, we believe that the long anticipated multifamily decline has indeed reached certain geographic markets, even as others continue to have significant units in backlog. And as I stated earlier in my remarks, commercial put-in-place spending is flattening while starts are slowing. Therefore, we expect commercial conditions to be a bit bumpy going forward as certain mega projects, data centers and some other less financing sensitive projects likely continue, while smaller project starts are expected to be more limited until we see some improvements in rates. Given this backdrop, let me turn to our expectations looking forward. Starting with wallboard volumes as compared to the prior year, we anticipate single-family to be up mid-single-digits for our fiscal first quarter, and as we progress through the balance of the year on normal seasonality and without any expectation for accelerated market recovery, we expect growth to be in the high-single-digits for single-family wallboard volumes on a year-over-year basis. Multifamily wallboard volumes will likely be flat to up slightly during our fiscal first quarter before declining progressively into the back half of our fiscal year. And commercial wallboard volumes are expected to be up low-single-digits for our fiscal first quarter before flattening for the next couple of quarters and then likely declining year-over-year in our fiscal fourth quarter. Considering all of these end-market dynamics, in total for GMS, first quarter wallboard volumes are expected to be up low to mid-single-digits and also up mid-single-digits in the next couple of quarters thereafter. After a nearly one-year pause in pricing actions, we believe we have begun a renewed inflationary period for wallboard. Our pricing for wallboard is expected to remain resilient this quarter as we continue to work to pass through the earlier announced manufacturer price increases. While implementation of these actions is taking longer than we would like, we expect to see some benefits from these price increases beginning in July, tempered by the impact of the expected mix shift from higher single-family volume. As such, we expect first quarter wallboard prices to be roughly flat as compared with the prior year period. Post our first quarter, we expect to see sequentially improved pricing in the low single-digits with further realization of this round of price increases. For steel framing, as noted, pricing and gross margin have softened more than we expected and demand will most likely be choppy as multifamily high rise and certain commercial projects conclude while key mega projects and other commercial activity continue. For the first quarter, we expect volumes to be up low to mid-single-digits year-over-year, a notable slowdown from fiscal 2024 with prices down low single-digits sequentially and down in the low-teens year-over-year. While the underlying rolled commodities are driven by other end market sectors and thus very difficult to predict, all of the major framing formers in our markets recently announced price increases, which should support some greater stability in future months. In ceilings, given the noted level of activity in our commercial end market, we expect low to mid-teen increases year-over-year for volume, inclusive of recent acquisitions, and a low to mid-single-digit increase for price and mix. All considered, we expect healthy mid to high-teens sales growth in ceilings for the next several quarters. Finally, net sales for our complementary products are expected to grow at mid-single-digit levels as compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2024, and we expect this pacing to continue through the remainder of the year. All in, as shown on Slide 9, we anticipate net sales for our fiscal first quarter to be up mid-single-digits as compared with a year ago, with organic sales up low single-digits despite the deflationary pressures in steel prices. For Q2 and the full year, we expect similar growth, but with some improved pacing versus Q1. Principally on the continued pressures in steel pricing and the still in process implementation of wallboard pricing, we'd expect first quarter gross margins to be constrained versus prior year and prior quarter at approximately 31.5% before returning to more normal levels around 32% for the remainder of our fiscal year, despite actions being taken to manage near-term discretionary and investment spending. We also expect that deflationary steel pricing relative to strong delivery activity will continue to have a deleveraging effect on SG&A for the quarter before improving later in the year. As a result, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $160 million to $165 million for our fiscal first quarter, with a slight margin improvement from our fourth quarter. Assuming general stability elsewhere, given our outlook for markets and the actions we are taking to manage within them, we expect second quarter EBITDA margins to be consistent with prior year. And on a stronger overall year-over-year growth profile for the full year, we also expect to see year-over-year profitability improve in subsequent quarters. Thank you for joining us today. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.Carey Phelps: Kath? Just a minute guys. Sorry for the delay. We will -- we are trying to communicate electronically here with the operator. [technical difficulty]Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the technical inconvenience. Please stand by. The event will resume momentarily. We will take our first question coming from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.Noah Merkousko: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. This is Noah Merkousko on for Trey.Operator: [technical difficulty] I apologize for that. Go ahead and continue, please.Noah Merkousko: All right. Some cool tunes. Yes, so just --John Turner: Hi, Noah.Noah Merkousko: Hi. Yes, so just wanted to touch on wallboard pricing. I mean, it sounds like there's maybe some limited traction, but it's kind of taking longer than expected, and we'll kind of see that play out in the coming quarters. And so I guess, first I was wondering if you could kind of break out what you see as, like-for-like pricing versus what you're seeing from a negative mix impact as you see single-family accelerate relative to commercial.John Turner: Yes, I mean, as we stated just now in the call, I mean, I think, like-for-like, pricing, we'll see low single-digit appreciation in the price of wallboard for both commercial and residential wallboard as we go forward. We're going to -- we expect some improvement in July. We've achieved some pricing with some of our larger national account customers, which we expect to come in in July. We've already achieved a little bit of pricing this quarter, believe it or not, and we would expect most of it to be realized in the second quarter.Noah Merkousko: Okay. And then -- but then you've got the mix -- negative mix impact on top of that. That's kind of keeping it at this sort of flattish…John Turner: Yes. So from a price perspective, though, I mean, that's why we just guided back to 32% gross margins later in the year, is because we're having an expected pretty good year-over-year single-family market, even though when you read the headlines, it's not terribly significant. But last year was so bad, single-family wise, that based on the activity we've seen so far, that's where we're going to get that single-family growth on a year-over-year basis. And, of course, that's the largest consumer of wallboard in any of our end markets of the single-family.Noah Merkousko: Okay, that makes sense. And then maybe on that margin, I mean, 30 -- yes, 31.5% in the quarter. I guess, if we're just looking at wallboard, is it just the delayed impact of pricing and that catches up later, like you said, or is there something else going on?John Turner: No. I mean, it is. But two thirds of our expected miss in -- I would say, expected miss, we've never really given the quarter before, but in our own internal view, about two-thirds of what we would call the headwind for the quarter is the steel and about a third is wallboard. So we see both improving as we move through the second quarter. But yes, for the wallboard question in particular, it's just the realization of the price increases taking us a little longer than we'd like.Noah Merkousko: All right, thanks. That's helpful. I'll leave it there.John Turner: Thank you, Noah.Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.Matthew Bouley: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just sticking on the wallboard piece, I know you mentioned that mix is kind of the offset here into the next quarter. I mean, as we kind of think about the shape of, I guess, volumes as you're talking about how this year will look where new residential really is kind of the source of volume growth, I mean, presumably the mix headwind would persist. So can you just kind of put a little color on how you think about Q2, Q3, Q4, if really new resi is the big driver of growth, what that would do to the mix effect on wallboard price? Thank you.John Turner: I mean, it really should be flat over the next couple of quarters in total. Maybe we can do a little bit better than that. But the gross margins improve because the cost of service -- well, the operating margins improve, but so do the gross margins improve because at the end of the day, both commercial and single-family growth margins are similar. But the net headline price is going to be flat. But as both go up, the gross margin dollars improve, gets us back to that 32% and takes us back into pretty good profitability.Matthew Bouley: Got it. Okay, thanks for that. And then secondly, I guess, also back down to the margin side, so the gross margin, I guess, one quick clarification, how much in that guide of 31.5 is purchase accounting from Kamco? So if you could quantify that. But then just kind of higher level, when you think about getting back to 32, I'm curious if there's any kind of, I don't know if there's like a temporary inventory headwind on the gross profit that would dissipate if you saw price stability. So just any kind of color on that. And I guess, I'll squeeze this one in here too. But the EBITDA margins being consistent year-over-year in the second quarter, does that also mean you should be getting to SG&A leverage beginning in Q2? So sorry for all the questions, but if you could address that. Thank you.Scott Deakin: I'll speak to the first one, Matt. We talked about the purchase accounting impact in Q4. We wouldn't expect any further continuance of that into Q1 at the cost of sales line will obviously have impacts related to G&A and amortization on the step-ups and those types of things. But with regard to cost of sales, you shouldn't see anything there.John Turner: I'm going to address the last part of your question because I remember it better. Yes, we should start seeing some SG&A leverage in Q2. It's not going to be dramatic, but it's going to be good to get us to flat EBITDA margins on a year-over-year basis. With expected sales north of that mid-single-digit range, we expect Q2 to kind of rebound nicely for us.Matthew Bouley: Yes. Got it. Okay. And I was asking about the kind of inventory headwind. Is there any kind of inventory headwind, given deflation, that would dissipate or is it temporary?Scott Deakin: No. So we don't have deflation in wallboard. So we're not placing that on the wallboard side. On the steel side, it comes through pretty quickly. So we pass pricing and steel through much faster, either up or down. So, no, we don't anticipate having a big problem with inventory. You know, the steel market being commercial, a lot of the larger commercial work is protected for a period of time through bid activity and through commitments at the manufacturing level to us. And so the shorter term business, the more stock steel business, it turns very, very, very quickly, so we don't anticipate a big squeeze in steel.Matthew Bouley: All right, thanks, guys. Thanks for addressing all that. Appreciate it.John Turner: Absolutely. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Manthey with Baird. Please proceed with your question.David Manthey: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. JT, last December on the call you addressed each of your three key end markets. You talked about the possibility of an air pocket in commercial demand during calendar '24. You talked about a moderation in multifamily once you work through the backlog and then a recovery in single-family housing demand. The overlay there, though, you said that easing in credit markets will drive expansionary improvements thereafter. And just given the lack of rate movement, could you contrast your current outlook in those three categories with that six months ago?John Turner: Sure. I think multifamily, you know, that was kind of already baked in, right, and so we -- there's still 900,000 units out there as of the last report. I mean, I think this morning the new report came out, but we're on here with you guys. So 900,000 units in the last report, they build about 450,000 units a year. So we really felt like we had another -- we feel like we have another couple of quarters before we start to see the big declines there. So nothing's changed in my mind there. I think my hopeful side on single-family would have been that we would have started to at least get an indication that rates were coming down by now. And of course, it seems like higher for longer. Although maybe there's some September relief. I doubt it. Probably, post the election, I think we'll start seeing some rate relief, which is good for next year. So the thing our single-family view is the same as I gave you before, but I don't think we'll see a lot of upside to what we've just talked about. In commercial activity, I mean, it's really bumpy. I think it's probably a little worse than I would have guessed six months ago based upon just more difficult financing environment for privately financed projects. Will the mega projects offset all of it? I don't think so. I think that's why we talked about maybe having some declining year-over-year results in fourth quarter of next year, relatively flat Q2, Q3 type overall commercial activity.David Manthey: Okay, thank you for that. And second, as it relates to the single-family side, I don't know exactly what timeframe you're talking about. You said through April up 26%, and I'm not sure if that correlation is to your 2.8% single-family sales per day in the April quarter. And I know there's a difference in starts and completions of the gap there. Could you address that? And then just in terms of within single-family housing, are you seeing any noticeable trends of the square feet of wallboard you're selling per housing start? Is there any size issue that is also influencing the numbers?John Turner: Yes. Let me address the second comment first. Interestingly enough, we are not seeing in our big national accounts less wallboard per unit. But I think what we're seeing is we're seeing more single-family versus townhouse activity. And so while the single-family houses are using a little less wallboard, the townhouse activity is much slower than it was before. And so we're seeing more actual single-family going into that -- going into that market or going into that demand picture for us. As far as the timing goes on, the 26% -- so let me tell you what the 26% was. That was the non-seasonally adjusted starts through April. So if you look at the single-family starts through April, non-seasonally adjusted, that was the Census Bureau's number of 26% year-over-year improved starts, those probably follow on in a six to nine month period. And so that's why we see accelerated single-family sequential growth for us as we get through our Q1 and into Q2 and Q3, which is why we just talked on the call of having our growth rate be better than mid-single-digits in Q2 and Q3, almost all of that being driven by single-family activity.David Manthey: Got it. That sounds great. Thanks, JT.John Turner: Thank you, David. I appreciate it.Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group. Please proceed with your question.Brian Biros: Hi, good morning. This is actually Brian Biros on for Steven. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe to start on the residential side, large homebuilders have seen a lot of share gain kind of in the past few years here. Can you kind of just refresh us on higher positions in the past couple of years of this and then higher positioning for the upcoming years, kind of strategic efforts you guys are making to benefit from the large homebuilders share gain?John Turner: Yes. I mean, we've talked about it now kind of multiple quarters in a row. We continue to gain share with the larger homebuilders. Our scale and national presence is important for the national homebuilders. As the national homebuilders tend to be more center-led over time, that actually helps us as their center-led purchasing organizations and center-led construction organizations value what we do, more so. So I think we talked about it. If the national homebuilder was representative of 35% share -- 30%, 35% share of the total, we're probably 45%. 50% of our share is upwards almost of our newbuilder businesses, national home builders.Brian Biros: Got it. And then second on ceiling volumes performing pretty nice in the past few quarters here, looks like you're expecting another strong performance in Q1. Can you kind of touch a little bit further on kind of what's driving that kind of thinking about the end markets there with tenant improvement kind of weak, not great, kind of just what are the headwinds and tailwinds now? Thank you.John Turner: Yes. So office is your headwind, right? I mean, still office activity, remodel activity in office, pretty quiet. And the tailwinds are data centers, public and private education in the healthcare space. So those three are really good right now. And so data centers use a tremendous amount of ceilings, suspended ceilings, obviously, primary education, secondary education, lots of suspended ceilings and that activity is really strong. You can see it in the Census Bureau reports on where the commercial spending is still growing, still growing and healthcare still growing in education. You know, if you look at the -- it shows that it grows in office, but that's data centers. They have data centers rolling into the office category. So that's really your strength there.Brian Biros: Got it. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Mike Dahl: Thanks for taking my questions. I want to start on steel pricing. So obviously we've seen some increased attempts over time, which in the recent past have proven unsuccessful. You saw weakening through the quarter. You talked about weakening month over month through 1Q. I guess, what's giving you confidence that we see stability thereafter? It's unclear fundamentally whether anyone's blinked on capacity demand, you've pointed out, is still choppy. So why would this time be different on the steel price increases? And then maybe if you take your comments for 1Q as far as where you'll end up at the exit rate, thinking about carryover deflation into 2Q and beyond.John Turner: Yes, we've got Q1 down low single-digits sequentially, and we have Q2 flattening with the price increase announcements and kind of staying there. We're kind of -- we feel like we're near a bottom. The underlying commodity seems to be bottoming or has bottomed. Of course, we've seen that before. I think every one of your comments is very fair. For us, as I don't want to call ourselves a victim by any stretch of the imagination, but we're certainly not the driver of steel prices and we're a very small part of the overall steel market. So I think ultimately what's going to stabilize steel is going to be a lower-rate environment which is going to help people go out and buy cars and buy appliances, and do all the things that they'd like to do. You know, the used car market doesn't help us. Obviously, the new car market does. And so everybody's buying used cars right now because the cost of a new car is crazy. So I think that what you'll see with rates coming down and you'll see a stabilization in a lot of places for us, but steel in particular. But right now we feel like the forming - the steel formers who we buy from seem to be pretty adamant that this price increase is necessary and will stick. So we'll see. We even put that in our comments here on that -- in that particular case, and we're calling out an inflationary environment in wallboard, not yet calling out an inflationary environment in steel. But what we have is sequential declines through this quarter and then a flattening as we go through the balance of the year. That's what's in our outlook.Mike Dahl: Okay. And then -- just so then to follow up and to tie it into my second question then. So if we're down low single-digits in 2Q and flat thereafter, it still seems like there will be some carryover year-on-year deflation. If you could size the year-on-year, what that would imply for 2Q? And then back to the SG&A dynamic, if you're continuing to see the steel pricing pressure, and I think appreciate your comments on kind of the accelerated top line, but a lot of that is also acquisition driven, which hasn't really levered SG&A some of the dynamics around some inflationary pressures based on everything we hear from everyone else seems like those dynamics are relatively sticky. So I guess, I'm still looking for a bit better of a bridge to get to such a quick return to SG&A leverage in this environment.John Turner: Well, again, in that quarter, we have steel prices flat sequentially. This quarter is where we're going to -- this is our Q1. Our Q1 is where we have it down low single-digits, then flat sequentially thereafter because the price increases have all been announced for July. So we don't expect to see a lot of steel deflation post this quarter. Scott's comments indicated that this quarter we do. And going forward, though, we also don't have much volume in the steel business, right? So we're basically looking at steel being flat sequentially from a volume perspective. So we're not double -- fighting that double whammy of a declining price and delivery expense. So that's a big reason as to why the SG&A flips in Q2. But also the SG&A flips in Q2 because we've got strong wallboard volume and a lot of that's residential and the cost to deliver that is lower than the commercial cost to deliver. And so we expect that as that happens that we'll be able to manage our SG&A. And additionally, I mean, we're doing a lot of things internally as that commercial market and the multifamily market appears to be flattening and get preparing for decline, we're doing things internally you'd expect us to do, which is to control our G&A, right? So we're doing all of those things. So the big wild card is going to be steel in some respects into Q2. If what happens is what we believe will happen, I think we'll start leveraging SG&A in Q2 and post Q2.Mike Dahl: Sorry, I don't know if I'll get cut off here. But again, so I hear your comments on sequentially, that makes sense. But year-over-year, it still seems like some of those things would be headwinds. So when you talk about leveraging SG&A, are you talking about sequential or year-on-year, your SG&A percentage will be down year-on-year? Thank you.John Turner: Year-on-yea. And again, we're going to get wallboard price -- we're getting wallboard pricing too, right? So that's important. Wallboard is big part of the business still.Mike Dahl: Okay. Thank you.John Turner: Absolutely.Operator: Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of Jeffrey Stevenson with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Jeffrey Stevenson: Thanks for taking my questions today. So regarding near-term wallboard margin pressure, have you experienced an unusual amount of pushback from large national accounts than you've historically had passing along manufacturer price increases?John Turner: I mean, I'd say, it's about the same, except for in the environment we were in a couple of years ago when the demand, housing starts were in that 1.5 million, 1.6 million range where the demand outstripped the ability to supply. And so there were spotty service issues across the industry. You know, right now, what you're seeing is the industry is getting close to that environment again, and we think we'll probably be in that depending on what happens with commercial and multifamily to some extent, late in our fiscal year. But with any recovery in single-family, it's going to get pretty tight. So I would say that this is a pretty normal cycle for the big national homebuilders that we've talked to. And like I said, we've had some success in that recently in getting that there. I think the balance of the market is a little more difficult than we had anticipated in getting pricing. All that being said, we're going to push it through. And as I said, I think it was two years ago. I don't know if everybody remembers or three years ago, whenever it was, whatever we take, we're going to push through. And the timing of that may be a little bit elongated from time to time. But if we take pricing, it's going to go into the market, and that's where our heads are and that's where our guys are out executing today.Jeffrey Stevenson: Okay. Understood. And just for clarification, how did your wallboard price at the end of April compare with your average quarterly wallboard price? Because you reported a sequential improvement in February wallboard pricing last earnings call and wondered if pricing came off at all as the quarter progressed or if there was any changes more mix-related?John Turner: Yes, we were. 475, 475, 475. The February improvement went away pretty quickly with some national homebuilder mix picking up. So we were believing that we would see a little bit of sequential improvement in the quarter, but it was pretty much flat the entire quarter. So we exited at 475 as to answer but we basically ended it flat all quarter.Jeffrey Stevenson: Okay, great. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question and answer session, and this does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

And now for opening remarks and introductions, I will turn the call over to Peter.Peter Matt: Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to CMC's third quarter earnings conference call. I would like to start off by thanking our 13,000 employees for delivering another quarter of strong operational and financial performance. I am proud to announce that CMC has been named to the 2024, 2025 list of Best Companies to Work For by US News and World Report. Thank you to our dedicated employees for placing us among the best of the best. While I am proud of these results, I am even prouder that we have continued to improve our exceptional safety track record with reportable incidents well below the broader domestic steel industry. To that end, I would like to take a moment to recognize the outstanding improvements made at recently acquired facilities within our Emerging Businesses Group. They have been eager adopters of CMC's industry-leading safety culture and practices, which has resulted in higher employee satisfaction, lower turnover and fewer injuries. At CMC, it all begins with safety, and we won't be satisfied until we reach our goal of zero incidents, ensuring everyone leaves their shift in the same condition they arrived. This morning, I will provide an overview of CMC's third quarter financial and operating performance, after which I will discuss our view of the current and future market environment, before offering a brief update on key growth projects. Paul will cover the quarter's financial results in greater detail, and I will conclude with our outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter and beyond. We will then open the call to questions. Additional information regarding the quarter is provided in the supplemental slides that accompany this call, which can be found on CMC's Investor Relations website. As we reported in our press release this morning, the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was another period of strong financial performance. CMC generated core EBITDA, core EBITDA margin and net earnings per diluted share, well above historic averages. We continue to believe that our margin and earnings are normalizing at levels sustainably above pre-pandemic levels. This view is based on significant changes that have occurred in CMC's business and our industry over the last several years. The first change to mention is industry consolidation in which CMC played a central role with its acquisition of rebar assets from Gerdau. From a CMC perspective, this transaction created a much larger company and market leader with increased scale, improved operating flexibility and an enhanced value-generating asset base. The second change is an improved trade environment that recognizes the importance of the basic industries that play a vital role in our national economy and provides mechanisms to level the playing field with unfairly traded imports. The third change is once in a generation structural demand trends that are reshaping our economy and can be expected to propel construction activity for years to come, providing more visible and longer duration demand drivers for our business. In summary, this improved business environment should provide a favorable backdrop for our company to continue generating significant value for our shareholders. We believe there is much more to come. As mentioned on our previous earnings call, CMC is developing a compelling strategy to drive the next phase of value accretive growth. Our aim is threefold. First, achieving sustainably higher, less volatile, through the cycle margins that are fortified by our operational and commercial excellence initiatives; second, execute on attractive organic growth opportunities; and third, in a disciplined manner, pursue inorganic growth opportunities that broaden CMC's commercial portfolio, improve our customer value proposition, and meaningfully extend our growth runway. We are extremely excited about the journey CMC is embarking on and equally excited to share our vision with you in the near future. Returning to our third quarter results, CMC's reported net earnings of $119.4 million or $1.02 per diluted shares on net sales of $2.1 billion. We generated consolidated core EBITDA for the quarter of $256.1 million, producing a core EBITDA margin of 12.3% and a trailing EBITDA return on invested capital of 11.3%. Results in our North America Steel Group benefited from good underlying market fundamentals that yielded modest sequential margin expansion for steel products, healthy shipment levels of finished steel products, and stability in our downstream backlog volumes. Our Europe Steel Group continued a trend of improving financial performance, nearing breakeven on an adjusted EBITDA basis. CMC's team in Poland should be commended for the excellent job they have done managing all elements of the business under their control. They are cost leaders in the European industry and have reached new heights of resourcefulness and flexibility while managing through this challenging environment. CMC's Emerging Businesses Group generated strong results during the quarter, and its adjusted EBITDA margin returned to a level we believe to be more representative of the segment's potential. Now turning to CMC's markets in North America, construction activity remains healthy, and as I mentioned, fundamentals are broadly supportive. We experienced a typical seasonal uplift in rebar demand as we moved into the spring and summer construction season, and regional markets appear to be in good balance from an inventory and import perspective. This environment has provided the backdrop for stable to moderately improving steel product margins at well above historic levels. We continue to see a good pipeline of future construction projects coming to the market as measured by bidding activity within our downstream operations. This view is mirrored by key external forward-looking indicators, such as the Dodge Momentum Index, which remains 40% above pre-pandemic levels. Within this environment, we have been able to maintain seasonally appropriate levels of new contract bookings and a stable downstream backlog. We are also starting to see signs of increased infrastructure activity across several of our geographic areas. As shown on Slide 9 of the supplemental presentation, highway construction is the largest and most usage intensive market for rebar. So it is very encouraging to see growing demand. During the quarter, shipment volumes of fabricated rebar and mill-direct material increased on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Projects that were awarded over the last two years are entering the construction phase and beginning to consume steel. Additionally, there continues to be a solid pipeline of work entering the market for bidding. Texas, in particular, has seen an uptick in activity with the level of highway lettings this spring reaching multi-decade highs. Based on our current visibility and conversations with customers, we expect momentum in highway construction to build in the coming quarters and years. Leading forecasters anticipate similar trends. The Portland Cement Association expects cement consumption for highways and streets to grow approximately 4% in calendar year 2024 and approximately 5% in 2025. Dodge Analytics expects new highway construction starts to increase by 29% on an inflation-adjusted basis in 2024, following little change in either 2022 or 2023. Beyond highways, we are seeing good year-over-year growth in demand for public works, institutional buildings and data centers. Construction activity and rebar consumption at manufacturing projects remain well above historic levels. That said, shipments have leveled off recently as we wait for the next round of construction to commence at several semiconductor plants. We believe this trend is transitory, given the recent CHIPS Act funding allocations and public commitments by sponsors to expand facilities. While structural forces are driving activity within infrastructure, reshoring data centers and energy projects, the market for interest rate sensitive construction such as warehousing, office and multifamily residential remains softer. An inflection in interest rates could provide some support particularly within the residential sector, where a significant shortage of housing units exist, but affordability has restricted construction activity. Several third-party estimates indicate the US is facing a housing shortage of 1.5 million to 3 million units, which need to be addressed at some point in the future. With each new unit consuming 1 ton to 1.5 tons of rebar, we believe efforts to close the housing supply gap would meaningfully increase consumption. Based on each of the structural trends I just mentioned, we continue to believe that we are entering a once-in-a-generation investment cycle that will power construction activity for years to come. These opportunities should extend well beyond our traditional steel value chain and reach into CMC's other key solution offerings like Geogrid, Geopier anchoring systems and high-performance reinforcing steel. In fact, we are seeing signs of this recurring across our emerging businesses group footprint. Interest has been good from large manufacturing projects, including semiconductor facilities and major electric vehicle plants. Activity is also increasing in solar, where the Inflation Reduction Act is driving investment in large-scale installations across several regions of the US. CMC's Geogrid Solutions are used to provide access roads that aid initial construction as well as ongoing maintenance. In the future, construction of these solar fields can be expected to also benefit demand for our anchoring systems as new electrical transmission lines and substations are required to connect them to the energy grid. Large projects are emerging in infrastructure, particularly for port construction and rehabilitation, which benefits Tensar's business as well as its performance reinforcing steel offerings of high strength and corrosion-resistant products. Turning to the Europe Steel Group. The market environment was similar to last quarter, which marked a meaningful improvement from late fiscal 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. Consumption of long steel products have stabilized but remains well below historic levels. Polish steelmakers are demonstrating good discipline through significant supply reductions that have facilitated a rebalancing of the market. Some of the beneficial impact of lower domestic production has been offset by increased imports from nearby countries as steelmakers seek alternatives to weak home markets. Absent this dynamic, we believe the Polish long steel market could be further along in its recovery. As it stands today, the current supply-demand balance, even with increased imports, has provided a backdrop for greater stability in steel pricing and metal margins. We are seeing increasing or encouraging signs of a macroeconomic inflection in Poland. Inflation has cooled significantly and is now back to more normalized levels. The rate of GDP growth is expected to reach nearly 3% in 2024, with both residential construction and government-sponsored investments on the rise. We are cautiously optimistic that the emerging macro improvement will provide an environment for our Europe Steel Group to continue moving closer to breakeven during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Now, I would like to provide a brief update on the progress we've made during the quarter on key strategic projects. At our new Arizona micro mill, we focused our efforts during the quarter on commissioning merchant bar quality product or MBQ. As noted in our last earnings call, this action was intended to address pockets of excess rebar inventory that develops following the historic levels of rainfall in California during the second quarter. This surplus has been largely eliminated through a combination of better seasonal consumption and our market leadership in executing the temporary supply adjustments. As a result of the third quarter emphasis on MBQ, the AZ2 team has now successfully produced key product sizes in four of the six product families that the plant is designed to make. It also accelerated our ability to begin supplying the Western US with a suite of offerings that will eventually include nearly 200 different SKUs. Given improved inventory levels across the rebar supply chain and progress made in commissioning MBQ, we anticipate moving back to a more standard production schedule with a greater mix of rebar during the fourth quarter. Our current view is that the plant should achieve EBITDA breakeven on a monthly basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 or early in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Work at CMC's Steel West Virginia site is progressing well, and we are on plan for start-up in late calendar 2025. Foundations are nearly complete, and we have begun receiving equipment deliveries. We remain very excited about these key organic growth projects, which we expect when fully operational will lower cost to serve our markets, expand our product reach and unlock meaningful internal synergies within our operational network. With that, I will turn the discussion over to Paul to provide more detail on our financial results.Paul Lawrence: Thank you, Peter, and good morning to everyone on the call. As noted earlier, we reported fiscal third quarter 2024 net earnings of $119.4 million or $1.02 per diluted share compared to the prior year levels of $234 million and $1.98, respectively. You will have noticed from our press release this morning that we are no longer adding back Arizona 2 commissioning costs to either adjusted earnings or core EBITDA. This decision was made in light of heightened scrutiny around non-GAAP measures, particularly those involving operational start-up costs. Though these adjustments will no longer be reflected in CMC's non-GAAP measures, we plan to provide quantification of start-up costs as we view them as temporary in nature and not representative of our long-term earnings capability. For the third quarter, CMC incurred mill operational commissioning costs of $17.2 million on an after-tax basis. On a pretax basis and excluding depreciation, mill operational commissioning costs were $11.8 million. Consolidated core EBITDA was $256.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, representing a decline from the $384.5 million generated during the prior year period but still a historically strong result. Slide 12 of the supplemental presentation illustrates the year-to-year changes in CMC's quarterly financial performance. Profitability at our North American and Steel Group -- and Europe Steel Groups were negatively impacted by lower margins over scrap while benefiting from improved controllable cost performance. Adjusted EBITDA was unchanged in CMC's emerging business group, while consolidated core EBITDA margin of 12.3% remained above average historical levels and compares to 16.4% a year ago. CMC's North American Steel Group generated adjusted EBITDA of $246.3 million for the quarter, equal to $217 per ton of finished deals shipped. Segment adjusted EBITDA decreased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by lower margin over scrap costs on steel and downstream products. This pressure was partially offset by improved controllable costs on a per ton basis. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the North American Steel Group was 14.7% compared to 20.2% in the prior year period. We protect ourselves against price volatility exposure in the key nonferrous metals that we process at our recycling facilities. As a result of the historic run-up of copper prices that occurred during the quarter, we incurred an approximate $6 million charge during the quarter related to our open positions. As indicated earlier, rebar demand was healthy during the quarter, and we experienced a normal season uptick in volumes. Finished Steel shipments increased by 12.3% on a sequential basis, with similar performance across all geographies. Shipment volumes declined modestly on a year-over-year basis. And steel product metal margins increased marginally during the quarter and continues to demonstrate stability throughout fiscal 2024. Turning to Slide 14 of the supplemental deck. Our Europe Steel Group reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.2 million for the third quarter of 2024. This compares to a loss of $8.6 million in the prior quarter and marks the trend of continued improvement from the levels of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and the first quarter of fiscal 2024, during which time, quarterly losses averaged $30 million, excluding the impact of energy rebates. The sequential improvement was driven by higher margin over scrap costs, increased shipment volumes and lower controllable costs per ton. Controllable cost performance improved both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis as a result of lower energy pricing and operational measures taken across the footprint. As Peter mentioned, there have been some encouraging signs that the Polish market is past the bottom that the national economy is in a recovery mode. Emerging Business Group third quarter net sales of $188.6 million and adjusted EBITDA of $38.2 million were unchanged compared to the prior year period. On a sequential basis, net sales increased by 20.9%, while adjusted EBITDA improved by 113%, marking a strong rebound from the second quarter levels that were depressed due to the challenging weather. Activity benefited from improved seasonal demand and the start-up of several European and Middle East projects as well as strong product specific demand for our proprietary performance reinforcing steel. A healthy pipeline of new projects and good success in new contract awards provide for a strong order book as we exited the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the emerging business group was 20.3% was flat compared to a year ago period, but a significant recovery from our second quarter. Margin benefited from a richer mix of CMC's latest and higher-margin Geogrid solutions as well as our proprietary reinforcing steels. Moving to the balance sheet. As of May 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $698.3 million. In addition, we had approximately $794 million of availability under our credit and accounts receivable facilities bringing total liquidity to just under $1.5 billion. During the quarter, we generated $197.9 million of cash from operating activities, which included a modest release of cash from working capital. Capital expenditures of $82 million were driven by construction activity, principally related to our Steel West Virginia micro-mill project. CMC's leverage metrics remain attractive and have improved significantly over the last several fiscal years. As can be seen on Slide 19, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio now sits at just 0.5 times, while net debt to capitalization is only 9%. We believe our robust balance sheet and overall financial strength provide us the flexibility to finance our strategic organic growth projects and pursue opportunistic M&A while continuing to return cash to shareholders. CMC's effective tax rate was 25.5% in the third quarter. The year-to-date figure through three quarters stands at 24%, and we anticipate the effective full year tax rate of being between 24% and 25%. Turning to CMC's fiscal 2024 capital spending outlook, we are reducing our guidance to a range of between $400 million and $425 million. This is down meaningfully from the outlook we previously shared of $550 million to $600 million. The reason for this adjustment is the timing of specific payments related to equipment purchases for Steel West Virginia, which will slip from late fiscal 2024 into early fiscal 2025. This development only reflects recognition of payments and is not expected to impact the construction timeline or the start-up for CMC's newest micro mill. As outlined on previous calls, CMC targets a prudent and balanced approach to capital allocation. Our first priority is value accretive growth that furthers our strategic strategy and strengthens our business. Second is providing our shareholders with an attractive level of cash distributions in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. To this end, CMC has returned approximately $186 million to our shareholders through the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, equal to 49% of our net earnings. Looking at the third quarter, CMC repurchased approximately 931,000 shares at an average price of $55.64 per share. As of May 31, we had $458.6 million available for repurchase under our current authorization. With this, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back to Peter for additional comments on CMC's outlook.Peter Matt: Thank you, Paul. We expect consolidated financial results in our fiscal fourth quarter to be consistent with third quarter levels. Finished deal shipments within the North America Steel Group are anticipated to be flat on a sequential basis, while adjusted EBITDA margin should remain relatively stable. Adjusted EBITDA for our Europe Steel Group is likely to continue the trend of quarter-to-quarter improvement despite market conditions that are expected to remain challenging. Our financial results for the emerging businesses group should improve modestly driven by steady underlying market fundamentals and a healthy order book. The spring and summer construction season is off to a good start, and we are seeing encouraging signs of increased infrastructure activity driving demand. We expect this momentum to build over the coming quarters, contributing to an already healthy backdrop in North America, which is being propelled by positive long-term structural trends in manufacturing, reshoring, energy transition and energy security-related projects. Additionally, an inflection in interest rates has the potential to unlock pent-up demand in several construction sectors, including residential markets where a significant shortage of housing units exist. In Europe, the Polish macroeconomic environment is showing signs of improvement. Lower inflation and higher rates of economic growth should begin to bolster sentiment in the country and provide greater confidence to build and invest. We are proud of CMC's financial results and the strong industry that we have helped to create. We are excited about our potential to reach new height in the future as we execute our key strategic priorities and deliver significant value for our shareholders. Powerful structural trends in North America should drive construction activity for years to come, and CMC is well positioned to benefit. I would like to thank our customers for their trust and confidence in CMC and all of our employees for delivering yet another quarter of very solid performance.Operator: And today's first question comes from Sathish Kasinathan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.Sathish Kasinathan: Yeah, hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is on the North American downstream product pricing, which has been relatively resilient over the past few quarters. Based on your order backlog and then the new bids that are being placed right now, can you talk about the pricing and margin outlook through the end of the year and maybe into next year?Peter Matt: Yeah. We expect margins to stay relatively stable over the coming quarter and into next year. We have -- remember that in the downstream business, you're looking at pricing that was put in place a couple of months ago or on average nine months ago, right? So there is likely to be a downward trend in the pricing, but we expect the margin should be able to hold relatively stable.Sathish Kasinathan: Okay. Thank you. And then on -- my second question is on CapEx. With some of the spending related to the West Virginia mill now pushed into 2025, so how should we think about the total CapEx for next year?Paul Lawrence: Yeah, Satish, good morning. Obviously, our CapEx expenditures next year will be far greater than the guidance that we provided for this year. We're in the midst of our planning for 2025 at this stage. But as an initial guidance, we're thinking that the increase will likely be to around $600 million to $650 million for 2025.Sathish Kasinathan: And does it -- I mean, does it imply that there should be some CapEx left for 2026 also?Paul Lawrence: For fiscal 2026, as we finish off the mill and expecting to end and start commissioning late calendar 2025, yeah, there will be some smaller CapEx related to West Virginia into fiscal '24 as well.Sathish Kasinathan: Okay. Thank you.Paul Lawrence: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Tristan Gresser with BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY). Please go ahead.Tristan Gresser: Yes, hi, thank you for taking my question. The first one is on the market situation in the US. You mentioned a healthy start of the construction season, but the pricing indicators we look at don't necessarily indicate that. Usually, we see scrap prices move higher, price hikes on long products. And this time around, we didn't get any of that. So -- was there anything different with this construction season that is ongoing? And why does it appear weaker than usual? Thank you.Paul Lawrence: Well, I think when we look at the levels of bidding in the marketplace, they remain very strong. When we look at the levels of bookings, they look very good, too, on a historic basis. I mean, yes, down year-over-year but down 3% and again, against a very strong backdrop. So we feel very good about where demand is overall. And if you look at margins, what's happened is that while you've seen some erosion of pricing on a sales price perspective, you've also seen some erosion on the scrap side as well. So our margins have been able to stay relatively stable. When we look at scrap, and it seems like that's maybe what you're kind of pointing to, there are a couple of factors here that I think are important. One is, looking forward, it feels like scrap is getting close to a bottom. And I say that because we're starting to see that there are kind of lighter flows into our yards, which is typically an indication that the people with the scrap are less interested in selling it. Secondly, what we're seeing is a lot of the outages that we had in the beginning part of the year are now behind us. So demand is resuming. And the third thing I'd say is that there is a kind of on the margin, a stronger global bid for scrap. So we have every reason to believe that you should see scrap stabilize to potentially get a little bit stronger here, and then it might resume the trend that you're used to seeing. But I think the overall point is that in response to your question is that margins have been nicely stable through this period. And I would reinforce the point we made in the script, which is at well above historic levels.Tristan Gresser: All right. That's very helpful. My second question is on the guidance. So you guide for stable EBITDA. But if Europe improves a bit the EBG business is up slightly and you have stable margin volume development in North America, why shouldn't we see some modest improvement quarter-on-quarter? And going back to North America, if we get lower start-up costs with Arizona 2. And I think in the past quarter, you also flagged some lagged impact from lower scrap prices. That should also help so. Just trying to square that.Peter Matt: Yeah. Well, look, I mean it's possible that there's a level of conservatism in this. But I think there's also some risk that we're trying to factor in. And maybe since you started with Europe, let me just start with Europe. And so that, the market conditions there have been very difficult, and our team there has done an incredible job of kind of keeping costs low. But the imports that the Polish team is seeing from Germany are really making it difficult to break through. And so kind of as we say or as we target getting to breakeven that's not an easy exercise on an operational basis. We think we can do it, but it's not going to be easy. In EBG, we just posted, I think, a very nice quarter there. And we're confident about what we can do in the fourth quarter. But again, for the areas outside of the US affecting a business like Tensar, there is some risk in that, right? And we've seen that through the course of our fiscal 2024. So we're being a little bit cautious in that regard. I think in North America, there are -- as we've said, you've got these interest rate segments that are quite sensitive right now and are definitely weaker than what we'd like to see. And so that's another reason why we've got perhaps a little bit of conservatism in our estimate. We do believe that North America is going to stay kind of -- the demand is going to stay good overall. But again, if you're talking about moving margins higher, I think there, we're a little cautious about moving margins higher until we see that inflection in rates.Tristan Gresser: All right. That’s very clear. Thank you very much.Peter Matt: Thank you, Tristan.Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Curt Woodworth with UBS. Please go ahead.Curt Woodworth: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, Peter and team.Peter Matt: Hi, Curt.Curt Woodworth: Hey. So you noted that the rebar market in terms of supply/demand seems to be improving in the West and infrastructure kind of bidding and letting is picking up. So it would seem to suggest that Arizona 2 has room to continue to increase production and being optimized. But then you're also kind of guiding to flat shipments quarter-on-quarter. So is the way to think about it that maybe further optimization in Arizona is being may be mitigated by regional weakness or some of the interest rate sensitive parts of the market that you discussed?Peter Matt: Yeah. I think there's some fairness to that. I mean, again, so we -- in Arizona, we are expecting to be able to increase production as we put more rebar onto the mill. But you're right, we do have some of these segments that have some weakness, and so we're being kind of a bit measured in what we think we can do there. But I think that's fair.Curt Woodworth: Okay. And then I guess, just with respect to capital allocation, given the balance sheet and the free cash flow profile, you have pretty significant bandwidth to continue to fund organic growth and inorganic growth. So I just -- can you kind of comment on maybe how the M&A pipeline is looking? And then just given some of the distressed conditions in Europe, would Europe be an area where you would look to try to grow?Peter Matt: Okay. Thanks, Curt, for the question. So on organic growth, remember, we have some significant organic growth coming our way in the form of the Arizona ramp-up which we're still getting to EBITDA positive, that will be a significant contributor. And following shortly on from that, we've got West Virginia, and then beyond that, we've got a number of kind of, I'd say, much smaller from an order of magnitude, but organic projects across the portfolio that are either addressing kind of capacity needs to serve the demand in some of our kind of higher-growth markets and think about Tensar, Geogrid and so forth or to address kind of cost opportunities that we have through de-bottlenecking or making our operations more efficient. So we have a nice pipeline of organic opportunities here. The other thing I would say is that we're starting to get our arms around operational and commercial excellence in the company. We've done a lot of work around that. And that is going to provide a nice support to near-term organic growth. So then moving to inorganic growth, we do see opportunities out there, and we are working through precisely where we want to play. What I'll say at this point is, we want early-stage construction solutions, we want products that come onto the construction site at the same time that we come on, we want products that come ideally through the same channel and have attractive margins and ideally have a kind of an attractive penetration story like Tensar such that while they may serve some cyclical markets, they have the ability to produce a less volatile result given the kind of the penetration story that they can provide. Now what we're doing is we're looking at lots of businesses and trying to figure out where our sweet spot is and specifically, where we have competitive advantage and where we have a right to win and where we, as a company, bring the capabilities that are going to make us successful there. And so the nice thing is that we have some time because we've got this organic growth that's in the pipeline already that should fuel some growth in EBITDA over the next periods, while we kind of get our arms around where we want to be specifically. And as we do that, we'll obviously share more color with you on what we're thinking about. But it's -- we're really in the, I'd say, the second stage where we're refining work on things that we've been looking at and trying to go to the next level of detail on the businesses themselves. And I should just say on Europe, so Europe is -- I mean, conditions in Europe are difficult, as we've said on the last several calls. We wouldn't preclude growth in Europe given the kind of the situation that we're facing. But I think given the situation that we're facing growth in Europe would have to be very compelling now. And we'd have to have a clear pathway to returns that are substantially in excess of our cost of capital because I think the risk profile of that market as we've seen over the last couple of years is more challenging. Sorry for the long answer.Curt Woodworth: No. Very helpful. Thank you guys.Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Katja Jancic with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Katja Jancic: Hi. Maybe going back to Arizona 2 and looking to fiscal year '25, how should we think about the ramp up there or how much do you think the mill could produce?Peter Matt: Good morning, Katja. Yes, we continue to make good progress with respect to the commissioning activities at Arizona 2. And certainly, there's a lot of complex technology that is involved and introduced in that facility that ultimately, we are very confident that it puts us to really benefit from being a competitive advantage long term in terms of the nature of the production process there. We anticipate that we will see good ramp-up of activity in the fourth quarter. And then into next year, we're thinking roughly around 75% capacity utilization as an average for the year, starting a little bit below that and ending the year at a much higher rate. But overall, we're thinking about a 75% utilization rate. And as a reminder, we anticipate long term that the mill will have a product mix of roughly 150,000 tons of merchant product and 350,000 tons of rebar.Katja Jancic: And I think initially, it's going to be more rebar focused. And then I guess, as the year progressed, we could see more of the MBQs?Peter Matt: That -- it's a lot easier to produce the rebar since that is consistent. And so that ramp-up and commissioning, we've been very successful in achieving those levels. The commissioning and the slowdown, yes, we'll continue to be on the merchant side.Katja Jancic: Okay. And maybe one more on the CapEx side. So once the current project pipeline is completed, what would be a more normalized CapEx level?Peter Matt: Yeah, Katja, we believe that our smaller project and maintenance CapEx bucket. So those two combined really being in that $250 million range will represent the ongoing level of spend.Katja Jancic: Okay. Thank you.Peter Matt: Thanks, Katja.Paul Lawrence: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.Timna Tanners: Yeah, thanks. And happy first day of summer. I wanted to ask about a little bit more to hone in on the comments around the interest rate-sensitive construction component. I mean I think of most construction as being interest rate sensitive, but I suppose is that -- does that refer to nongovernment or shorter cycle projects? And if you could try to give us an idea of your end markets or of your shipments, how much of that would be in that category of interest rate sensitive that could potentially benefit from rate cuts?Peter Matt: Yeah. So what we've typically said is that about half of our portfolio has some exposure to interest rates and exposure in varying degrees. If we kind of parse it from there, the infrastructure, we do not think is interest rate sensitive. And there, the demand is really strong, and we've said it's going to continue to grow over the course of the next several years. When we get to nonresidential, which is kind of next 35% in that stack that you know that we always talk about, there, there are portions of that market that are interest rate sensitive and we would point to warehouses, office buildings, kind of light commercial, some lodging. And I don't know maybe that's third of that mix something that's a bit of a stab, but maybe that's the right number. And then on the residential side, Timna, again, the residential side, we think, has some kind of interest rate exposure. And there where we're seeing it mostly right now, as we said in the prepared remarks, is on the multifamily side. And so again, if we see an inflection in rates, we do think that you would see some kind of response in terms of incremental demand. What's been interesting is that we're not seeing projects canceled. They're just kind of hanging around. So -- and they're being bid and rebid and so forth. So our contention is that we should see some of them come back. And of course, as we said also in the prepared remarks, you've got this kind of backlog of housing demand that needs to be satisfied somehow. So I think that will kind of provide us more likelihood that, that comes to market.Timna Tanners: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then my second question is about your backlog. So you talked about the volumes bit healthy there, but I was trying to think about margins in that backlog because depending on the time frame of when they were contracted, prices were higher, now they're lower. Obviously, costs are lower. So I'm just trying to think about how that backlog is looking in terms of the margin profile relative to other past or recent quarters?Paul Lawrence: Yeah, Timna, as far as the backlog profile, as you know, it really -- the fabrication business is usually priced at a margin over and above where rebar pricing is, and as Peter said to an earlier question, on average, it's 9 to 12 months in duration from an average perspective. So one would expect that as rebar pricing has come down a little bit over the last -- well, really the first nine months of our fiscal year, that helps solidify some of the margin in the backlog. However, the pricing environment or that margin over and above rebar has been impacted by the lower amount of work that is being contracted today versus, say, 18 to 24 months ago when there was more activity in the space. And so overall, I think we're very encouraged that we're well above historic levels in the backlog. But it is -- the margins have returned a little bit to a more normalized level from where they were.Timna Tanners: And when you say margins returned to more normalized levels, is that also above historical levels, but not from the highs like somewhere in between the two? I guess.Paul Lawrence: Yeah. That's what I was trying to articulate, yes.Timna Tanners: Got it. Okay. Just making sure. All right, thanks for the help.Paul Lawrence: Thanks.Paul Lawrence: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead.Alex Hacking: Yeah, morning, and thanks for the call. I guess on Arizona, I'm not sure how much you disclosed on this, but as we think about Arizona ramping up, moving to profitability, what is the sort of EBITDA per ton uplift that you get from shifting production from an older mill that's outside the region to the new Arizona mill?Paul Lawrence: Yeah. Alex, if we look back to sort of historical view of our investment decision, as we acquired the Gerdau assets partially what they were servicing the Western US market from -- was from their California location. And the costs associated with doing business both from an environmental and energy perspective in California were substantial. And so we decided to build the Arizona facility. And clearly, the -- a lot of the benefits of the business case were on the cost reduction that ensued. As we built the mill, we were continuing to serve the market from our Eastern and Central facilities and incurring the freight costs in order to continue to see that market while we constructed the mill. And so what we -- we saw some of the benefit as we shuttered the California facility, but we will continue to see the benefit as we ramp up and avoid the freight cost of what we were providing to the West Coast. So, we continue to expect that there will be a margin pickup as we ramp up the Arizona facility. And it should be in line with our traditional margins that we produce on the rebar side.Alex Hacking: Okay. Thanks, Paul. And then on the residential side, I take your point that longer term, the US maybe short housing units. But if we look at the most recent data, it's not particularly encouraging, right? I think that the data out today starts down -- 20% of permits kind of the lowest in several years. Are you seeing that kind of weakness in your residential order book? Or is it not as bad as some of the headline data would suggest? Thanks.Peter Matt: Yeah. No. And I guess maybe we can talk offline about what data you're looking at. But if you look at the Dodge starts estimates for residential, they're showing kind of substantial upticks in kind of 2025 and beyond. And I would say our order book is showing kind of demand that stays at a healthy level and is, as we've said on several calls in the past, remains well above the kind of pre-pandemic levels. So yes, there's some weakness in multifamily, but we feel that it's -- that residential is going to be a good place to be here.Alex Hacking: Okay. Thanks. I was just referring to the US Census Bureau data that was released today.Peter Matt: Okay. I'll have to take a look at that.Alex Hacking: More than just multifamily. And then -- sorry, finally, on Tensar, I guess, on emerging business segment, I think when you acquired the business and subsequently, this is expected to be a growth business when we -- but if I look at revenue and EBITDA, it's effectively the same as it was last year. Is this still a business that we should be expecting to be growing? And I know there were some operating challenges that had created some constraints around growth in prior quarters, but maybe you could just give us some more color there? Thanks.Peter Matt: Yeah, absolutely. So, and what I would say is absolutely, it's a business we expect to grow. A couple of things that I think are worth noting. One is that on the positive side, you probably -- you're probably aware of the fact that we introduced a new Geogrid. And one thing that's been interesting about that is that the kind of both the volumes and the margins on that introduction have been in excess of what we were expecting, right? So the product continues to have a kind of a very strong reason to be and in a market that is, we believe, under-penetrated. I think we said something like 15% and it has applications on every construction site. So it's not on every construction site, but it's got applications on every construction site. You are right to call out the fact that we've had some operating challenges. And part of this is, honestly, it's the fact that we bought the asset from private equity, the operating facility. One of the operating facilities needed some catch-up maintenance. And so we've had to put some extra CapEx into it, and that's been kind of challenging to catch up on that, but we're on the way with that. We've got -- we've made all the changes we need to make, and we're kind of -- I think we're in a good position there or on the right path there. And we're actually investing in new capacity there to meet the demand side of the equation for Geogrid. So I think things are positive there. I think the other factor that I want to call out is, this business is not only a North American business. And the -- what we call the kind of Eastern Hemisphere, but it's really the rest of the world business as you know, from looking at the kind of the economic conditions in most of the rest of the world have been very varied and in many instances, quite weak. And so that has been a -- I don't want to say it's been a drag on growth, but it certainly muted any growth that we have. And the last thing I'd say about EBG generally, so this is moving away from Tensar is that we put these businesses in this portfolio because we strongly believe they all have the potential to grow. But one of the things we're doing just like with our overall growth strategy is we're in the process of getting organized around that growth. And that means bringing the people together, bringing the investment together to enable that growth. So you need to give us a little bit of time to kind of post that growth for you. But yeah, we definitely think Tensar is a growth business. We're super excited about it long term and EBG generally.Alex Hacking: All right. Thanks, Peter. Best of luck with everything.Peter Matt: Yeah, thank you, Alex.Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Matt for any closing remarks.Peter Matt: Thank you very much for joining the call today. As I said on the call, we believe that we are in a unique situation where the combination of structural supply and demand trends that we have noted, operational and commercial excellence initiatives to strengthen our through-the-cycle performance and value-accretive growth opportunities create an exciting opportunity for our company in the future. We're committed to balanced capital allocation strategy that includes investments in our company's future and a return of capital to our shareholders. And I want to thank you all for joining us on today's call. We look forward to speaking with many of you during the investor calls in the coming days and weeks. Thank you very much.Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation.

This morning Rick will share some brief remarks recapping the fiscal year. Raj will provide details on the fourth quarter and full-year financial results and share our fiscal 2025 financial outlook. And then Rick will close with some final comments. Now I will turn it over to Rick.Rick Cardenas: Thank you, Courtney. Before I begin, I would like to thank Kevin Kalicak for his leadership of Investor Relations for close to 10-years. As many of you know, Kevin has moved to Lead Finance for Olive Garden. We are excited for his new opportunity and equally excited to have Courtney transition into leading investor relations. I'm confident you will find Courtney a worthy successor. Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm proud of our ability to stay disciplined and control what we can control. This continued focus enabled us to have a strong year in what became an increasingly weaker consumer environment, especially for consumers below the median household income. For the full-year, we grew total sales by 8.6% to $11.4 billion, delivered adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $8.88, an increase of 11%, exceeding the high-end of the EPS range we provided at the beginning of the fiscal year, despite the challenging sales environment that emerged in the back half of the year. We opened 53 new restaurants in 24 states, eight of which were reopenings, and acquired and completed the integration of Ruth's Chris Steak House. Throughout the year, we strengthened and defended our four competitive advantages, and our restaurants remained focused on being brilliant with the basics. This has enabled us to successfully navigate whatever comes our way, including the increased discounting and marketing pressure we've seen recently. And when evaluating our performance within the context of our long-term framework of 10% to 15% total shareholder return as measured by EPS growth plus dividend yield, we delivered a TSR of 14.2% for fiscal 2024, which is near the high-end of our target. And as I said, our teams are focused on controlling what they can control. One of the ways we do that is by having well-trained, tenured team members. Our manager and team member retention is at or above pre-COVID levels, and our teams are benefiting from this staffing consistency, which helps create great guest experiences. We also provide our teams with training programs that not only enhance their skill sets, but build on the unique culture of our brands. Further strengthening engagement. For example, LongHorn recently completed their seventh steak master series. Over the course of two months, 1,000s of culinary team members competed in this highly engaging grilling competition and training program for the Right to be Crown Champion and received the $15,000 grand prize. Congratulations to this year's champion, Jacob Montgomery from the LongHorn Steak House in Cape Coral, Florida. Beyond providing strong labor and cost management, our operators are ensuring their teams remain focused on being brilliant with the basics, which is driving record guest satisfaction. Several of our brands reach all new time highs for overall guest satisfaction for the full fiscal year, including Olive Garden, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, Yard House, Season’s 52, and Bahama Breeze. Additionally, within the casual dining segment of technomics industry tracking tool, LongHorn ended the fiscal year ranked number one for food, service, atmosphere, and overall perceptions, as well as brand fit and loyalty. Now let me provide a final update on the integration of Ruth's Chris Steak House. During the quarter, we completed the transition of all company-owned restaurants onto both our proprietary point of sale and labor management systems, which were the final major changes for the restaurants. We also acquired a single franchise location in Destin, Florida during the quarter. Thanks to the hard work and collaboration between the Ruth's Chris team and our integration team, we closed on the acquisition and completed the integration during the same fiscal year. This included onboarding 5,000 new team members with no turnover among our nine directors of operations. We also achieved the expected synergies, resulting in EPS accretion of $0.10. Integration is not easy, and I'm particularly proud of the focus the restaurant teams maintained on the guest and team member experience throughout the process. Overall I'm pleased with our performance for the fiscal year. We successfully navigated a challenging environment and our proven strategy combined with the strength of our business ensures we are well positioned regardless of the operating environment. As we begin fiscal 2025, we remain focused on managing our business for the long-term by executing our strategy that drives growth and long-term shareholder value. We have also taken steps to further position Darden and our brands for future growth and success through several leadership changes. We are fortunate to have a deep bench of talent and these changes are designed to allow two of our most seasoned presidents to devote more time to developing our newest brand presidents. After nine years of leading LongHorn Steak House to record performance, Todd Burrowes has transitioned to a new role as President of Business Development. Todd now has responsibility for our new restaurant development and facilities team, our international and franchising business, and Ruth's Chris, our newest brand. Reporting to Todd are Mark Braun, Senior Vice President of Development; Brad Smith, President of International and Franchising; and Rick Jenkins, President of Ruth's Chris, who previously led operations for the brand. Todd is well suited to lead this work. He brings an operator's perspective to new restaurant development and our growing franchise business. Further, Todd was with LongHorn when we acquired Ruth's Hospitality (NASDAQ:RUTH) 17-years ago, and he will be a valuable leader and resource for Rick as the Ruth’s Chris team continues to acclimate to Darden. Todd's replacement at LongHorn is Laura Williamson. Laura is well respected across LongHorn, having served as their finance leader for nine years. She will report to me. We also named three new brand Presidents within our specialty restaurant group, who will report directly to John Martin, who continues to serve as President of the Specialty Restaurant Group. Bryan Clements, the Former Head of Operations at Olive Garden, is now President of Yard House. Falon Farrell, who led operations for Eddie V’s, has been named President of the Capital Grill in Eddie V's. And Mark Cooper, who led finance for the Special Restaurant Group, is now President of Seasons 52 and Bahama Breeze. I'm excited about these changes and confident we have the right leaders in place to drive future growth. I'm also proud that three of our seven brand presidents began their careers as hourly team members at our restaurants and the average tenure of all of our brand presidents is 27 years. Now I'll turn it over to Raj.Raj Vennam: Thank you, Rick. And good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2024 was another strong year for Darden, and I am proud of the results our teams achieved. Despite sales results that were weaker than we anticipated, earnings exceeded our initial expectations for the year. Strong cost management by our teams and easing commodities and labor inflation drove this earnings outperformance. Now looking at the fourth quarter, we generated $3 billion of total sales, 6.8% higher than last year, driven by the addition of 80 company-owned Ruth's Chris Steak House restaurants and 37 net new restaurants from our legacy brands. Our same restaurant sales were flat for the quarter, outpacing the industry by 80 basis points and same restaurant guest counts exceeded the industry by 130 basis points. Throughout the quarter our casual dining brands maintained their relative share of guest visits. Olive Garden guest count growth was near the top quartile of the industry and Long Horn Stake House was at the top decile of the industry. This is impressive when you consider the increased levels of discounting and promotional activity by some competitors within casual dining. Our same restaurant guest count or performance to the industry exceeded our same restaurant sales out performance due to our lower levels of pricing relative to the industry this quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 2.7% to $2.65. We generated $523 million in adjusted EBITDA and returned $254 million to shareholders through $156 million in dividends and $97 million of share repurchases. Turning to the fourth quarter P&L, compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 20 basis points better as commodities inflation was better-than-expected at approximately 2%. Seafood deflation this quarter helped partially offset mid-single-digit beef and produce inflation. Restaurant labor was 10 basis points better, driven by productivity improvements and favorability and other benefits, which more than offset the impact of pricing below labor inflation, which was approximately 4%. Restaurant expenses were 10 basis points better than last year driven by strong cost management and lower pre-opening expenses. Marketing expense was 1.3% of sales, consistent with our expectations and 20 basis points higher than last year. This all resulted in restaurant-level EBITDA improving 20 basis points to 20.9%. Adjusted G&A expenses were 40 basis points lower and the total expense was slightly favorable to our previous guidance. This was driven by ongoing synergies from the integration of Ruth's Chris and favorable mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation. Due to the way we hedge mark-to-market expense, this favorability is largely offset on the tax line. Interest expense increased 40 basis points due to the financing expenses related to the Ruth’s Chris acquisition. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.4%, 40 basis points higher, driven by the mark-to-market hedge impact I referenced earlier. And we generated $318 million in adjusted earnings from continuing operations, which was 10.8% of sales. Looking at our segments for the quarter, Olive Garden increased total sales 0.7%, driven by new restaurant growth partially offset by negative same restaurant sales of 1.5%. While Olive Garden same restaurant sales were below the industry, same restaurant guest counts outperformed the industry benchmark by 60 basis points. This dynamic was due to our decision to minimize pricing. For the quarter, Olive Garden pricing was approximately 1%. Olive Garden segment profit margin of 22.8% continues to be industry leading. At LongHorn, total sales increased 7.2%, driven by same restaurant sales growth of 4% and new restaurant growth. LongHorn same restaurant sales outperformed the industry by 480 basis points. Segment profit margin of 19.1% was 50 basis points above last year. Strong cost management, including improved labor productivity drove LongHorn's margin growth this quarter as pricing was below inflation. Total sales at the fine dining segment increased with the addition of Ruth’s Chris company-owned restaurants. And despite negative same restaurant sales at Capital Grille and Eddie V's, the fine dining segment's profit margin expanded in the fourth quarter, driven by improvement in our cost base. The other business segment sales increased with the addition of Ruth’s Chris franchise and managed location revenue. This was partially offset by combined negative same restaurant sales of 1.1% for the brands in the other segment. Segment profit margin of 17.4% was 160 basis points better than last year, driven by the sales leverage from the additional royalty revenue. As we look at our annual results for fiscal 2024, we had same restaurant sales growth of 1.6%, outperforming the industry in same restaurant sales and traffic by about 300 basis points. And this is on top of 500 basis points of outperformance in traffic last year. We delivered $1.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations. This is an increase of over 50%, compared to five years ago. Additionally, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders with $628 million in dividends and $454 million in share repurchases. Looking at our fiscal 2024 full-year P&L, we had restaurant-level EBITDA growth of 120 basis points driven by strong cost management by our teams and pricing leverage. This favorability was partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense and the impairment expense related to eight permanent closures that occurred during the year. This resulted in operating income margin that was 50 basis points higher than last year. Additional financing expenses primarily related to the Ruth’s Chris acquisition drove adjusted interest expense 40 basis points higher than last year. This all resulted in adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 9.4% flat to last year. Looking at our performance since 2019 relative to our long-term framework, we generated annualized EAT growth of 8% and cash returns of 3.7%, culminating in total shareholder returns of 11.7% as measured by EPS growth plus dividend yield. This is well within our targeted range despite the issuance of 9 million shares of common stock in fiscal 2020 and other business disruptions from COVID. A strong operating model generates significant and durable cash flows. Since 2019, we have delivered 9% annualized adjusted EBITDA growth. Our balance sheet at the end of fiscal 2024 is well positioned with adjusted debt to EBITDAR at 1.9 times. This is below our targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times, even with the additional debt related to Ruth's Chris acquisition. Now turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2025, we expect total sales of $11.8 billion to $11.9 billion, driven by same restaurant sales growth of 1% to 2% and 45 to 50 gross new restaurants. Capital spending of $550 million to $600 million, total inflation of approximately 3%, which includes commodities inflation of approximately 2% and labor inflation of approximately 4%. An annual effective tax rate of approximately 13% and approximately 119 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year. All of this results in diluted net earnings per share between $9.40 and $9.60. Finally, our board approved a 7% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $1.40 per share, implying an annual dividend of $5.60. And with that, I'll turn it back to Rick.Rick Cardenas: Thanks, Raj. All of us at Darden continue to work together in pursuit of our higher purpose to nourish and delight everyone we serve, our guests, team members, and communities. During the year, we had the privilege of serving 420 million guests, more than 1 million per day, providing great food and drinks with attentive service in an engaging atmosphere. We also promoted 1,100 hourly team members into our manager and training program and promoted nearly 300 managers to general manager or managing partner positions. And we continue to invest in our team members with programs like Fast Fluency, which provides the opportunity to learn English for free, and our next course scholarship program that, through the Darden Foundation, has awarded 200 scholarships worth $3,000 each over the past two years to children of our team members. We also remain committed to nourishing and delighting the communities we serve through our ongoing efforts to fight hunger. As part of our Harvest Food Donation Program, our restaurants donated 4.5 million meals to local food banks in fiscal 2024. We also continued our successful partnership with Feeding America with another $2 million donation from the Darden Foundation that helped provide mobile food trucks to 10 more Feeding America food banks, bringing the total to 45 trucks provided over the last four years. To wrap up, I want to thank our team members in our restaurants and our support center for their outstanding efforts throughout the year. Their disciplined approach in executing our strategy is what enables us to succeed, regardless of the operating environment. Now I will take your questions.Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.Brian Harbour: Yes, thank you. Good morning, guys. Maybe first just on your sales outlook for the year. Could you comment on how you see kind of the different brands feeding into that? And you obviously have very different kind of comparisons as we think about the start of the year versus the end of the year. Presumably there's kind of some pickup in Olive Garden. How do you think about the drivers of that?Raj Vennam: Hey, Brian, this is Raj. Good morning. So let's just start with the guidance at a high level from a sales outlook, right? Before we get into the brand level. So when we take a look at the upcoming year, we look at the information that's out there and where the macro is expected to be. And as you all know, most economists are expecting weakening GDP growth. So that's taken into consideration. Then we're also taking into consideration what we're cycling through, right? We started to see a little bit more weakness in the back half of this fiscal year, so we're taking that into consideration as we look at next year. So when we look at how we built this estimate and guidance, we are -- we expect underlying traffic trends to gradually improve throughout the year. And so that's really how we built it. I don't want to get into the exact details on the brands, but at a blended level, we're thinking 1% to 2% same restaurant sales growth for the full-year. And as I said, gradual improvement through the year on the underlying trends. And then there's just one callout is Thanksgiving shifts out of Q2 into Q3. So Q2 print might look better than the underlying trends, and Q3 will be the opposite. So that's typically about somewhere around 80 to 100 basis points impact on sales in the quarter. Positive for Q2, negative for Q3. And so all that said, in this current environment, there's more variability around our sales guide, but we have higher levels of confidence in our earnings outlook. And so, that's kind of where we are.Brian Harbour: Okay. Thank you. And maybe could you just comment on your pricing thoughts at this point within that? Is there anything we should keep in mind with respect to timing? Is there perhaps some that you would delay in an effort to keep it more modest at the start of the year?Raj Vennam: Yes, Brian, the good news on pricing is we've actually kept pricing very modest over the last five years, right? So we do expect pricing for this year to be more in line with inflation, so in that 2.5% to 3% range probably. But as we think about how that's going to be spread, we expect it to be more consistent quarter-to-quarter. Now, there may be a 10, 20 basis points movement between quarters. But if you look at over the last five years, we've only priced a lot and that gives us some flexibility and we've talked about that before. So we've underpriced about 20% over the last five years, compared to where the overall CPI is, which I think was close to 23% on the same five-year basis and then full services at 28%. And underpriced grocery as well. So we feel like we've done a lot of work on keeping prices low and we're going to continue to do that. And as you saw that in the fourth quarter too. We talked about Olive Garden closer to 1% pricing in the fourth quarter.Brian Harbour: Sounds good. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.Lauren Silberman: Great. Thank you. Just first on your approach to marketing. So Olive Garden comp's have been weak over the past couple of quarters. Some share losses quarter understand on a traffic basis. You outperformed. But as you think about your approach to marketing and promos, how does that influence your decision to increase marketing and what are you expecting for fiscal ‘25?Rick Cardenas: Yes, Lauren. In regards to marketing, we've said in the past that we'd probably tick it up a couple of tenths a year and that's probably what we'll do in fiscal ‘25. But we're going to continue to focus in our marketing efforts on our filters, which we've talked about many times. And we're not going to do things to buy sales, even with the increasing discounting our competitors are doing. You know, our best way to drive sales is our focus on a back to basics operating philosophy and our guests telling others what a great value they have when they come to our restaurants. And just remember, we do have levers to pull. We do have more marketing to pull if we want to, but our focus is on profitable sales growth.Lauren Silberman: Great. Thank you for that. And just a follow-up on the consumer environment. Is this mostly related to the low-income consumer? Just what are you seeing across the middle income, high income, across the breadth of your brands? Thanks so much.Rick Cardenas: Yes, Lauren. It is mostly at the income -- at the consumer below the median household income, which is about $75,000. Consumers are generally concerned about inflation, and they're becoming more concerned about the job market. And what we're seeing are some behavior shifts that we had already started to see. So for Q4, transactions from households below -- with incomes below the median were lower than last year. So -- and that's more pronounced with consumers below $50,000 in income. And these impacts were even greater in our fine dining brands. So that's why you saw fine dining had a little bit more negative comp than others. But at the same time, our guests aren't managing their check like we've seen in prior quarters. And so, you know, we continue to tell you what this means for our brands. Operators that deliver their brand promise and value will continue to appeal to consumers despite economic challenges, and that's what we're focused on doing. We're focusing on giving the consumers that are coming to our restaurants and spending their hard-earned money a great value and a great experience and have them tell others to come back.Lauren Silberman: Thank you very much.Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.Eric Gonzalez: Hi. Thanks for the question. I think I just heard you say that your guests aren't managing the check the way you've seen in prior quarters. Can you make a comment on why you think that's the case?Raj Vennam: Hey, Eric. So yes, we did. So if you think back to what we said earlier in the fiscal year, we were seeing a big negative mix on the check and we talked about that, especially both at casual brands and fine dining. And last quarter we said we started to see some moderation. And as we look at this year, this quarter, if we look at Olive Garden and LongHorn, basically the mix was flat. So basically there was no negative mix at all, which is a significant improvement. And then when you look at fine dining, you know, we saw some moderation in Q3 and that continues to moderate into Q4. I think we're now down into the 80, 90 basis points range in the negative mix versus the 200 or so that we were seeing a couple quarters ago. So we're just starting to see the ones that come to us are not managing the check as much as they used to.Eric Gonzalez: Okay. And then just maybe on the guidance, you know, there was a fairly wide gap in comp performance between Olive Garden and LongHorn this quarter. You know, you have that 1% to 2% guidance for next year. If you're not willing to break it out by brand in terms of guidance, but maybe you can comment on whether you'd expect that performance gap to widen or stays as wide as it is, or do you think it's going to converge in FY ‘20 cuts?Raj Vennam: Eric, the way we are looking at it is most brands are going to be within the range we provide it. We are providing a 1% to 2%. I'm not going to get into the comments about the range between Olive Garden and LongHorn specifically, but when we look at 1% to 2%, we expect most brands to be in that range. And obviously Olive Garden being over 50% of the portfolio, they'll have -- they weigh the Darden average too. And if you look back at last year, fiscal ‘24, we delivered 1.6% in same restaurant sales for Darden, and Olive Garden was right on top at 1.6%. So we'll see how this plays out, but we don't want to comment on Olive Garden versus LongHorn specifically.Eric Gonzalez: Very good. Thank you so much.Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Charles with TD Cowan. Please proceed with your questions.Andrew Charles: Great, thanks. Rick, the question is on Olive Garden. You called out multiple levers at your disposal to help properly go traffic beyond marketing. Can you expand more on those opportunities? Is it menu innovation? Is it the to-go business, the catering business? Just to welcome more thoughts on how to sustain the traffic gap versus the industry?Rick Cardenas: Hey, Andrew. Yes to all. Now, remember, Raj said we did exceed industry benchmarks. Olive Garden has taken much lower pricing than Darden over the year and the industries over the years. And we're really proud of their team. We're really proud of Dan and the team and what they've done. You know, they're going to continue to focus their marketing on their key equity of never-ending, craveable, abundant Italian food, specifically focusing on ensuring every guest is offered a refill with their first course. That's something that's not provided in other competitors. So that refill is a pretty big part of what we do and a big part of their value equation. But we're also going to continue to innovate over in our menu. What you see right now on television if you haven't is our Create Your Own pasta at $12.99. You know, consumers in more challenging times are looking for more price certainty, and that is an amazing value to create your own pasta at $12.99 with unlimited first course. And we'll continue to focus our marketing efforts there. And we have digital marketing that we can pull as well. So without getting into all the details, we do have levers to pull, but I want to remind everybody we're focused on profitable sales growth, not just buying sales to show a top line number. And we've been very consistent over the years with that. That profitable sales growth is what matters and Raj talked about our EBITDA growth over the last five years, how strong it was. And so we'll continue to focus there.Andrew Charles: Okay, great. And my final question is about the Ruth's acquisition for franchisee. Curious if this leaves you open-minded for more franchise acquisitions in 2025 or if this one was perhaps more one-off?Rick Cardenas: Yes, let me start by saying the franchisees at Ruth's Chris are really valued partners to us. And our focus was on integrating our company on restaurants into Darden. You know, this one restaurant franchise was an opportunistic purchase. So, you know, we're going to continue as is and speak with our franchisees if they want to speak with us, but right now we're going to continue to focus on making sure our team gets acclimated to the systems that we've implemented. And so it's not necessarily a change in strategy. It was an opportunistic purchase for us.Andrew Charles: Very good. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.David Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. Raj, I just wanted to come back to the guidance for the year. And I think you mentioned that you have assumed that you expect underlying traffic to improve as the year moves on. So I just wanted to ask if you could elaborate on what factors you think will drive that improvement? Is it mostly just comparisons related or are you thinking there's something inside the business that will improve on a sequential basis as the year moves on?Raj Vennam: David, it's primarily driven by the comparables, but the underlying trends have held up pretty well. I mean, even if you look at our fourth quarter that we just came off, month-to-month underlying trends were actually held up pretty steady, and it was an improvement from Q3. And you know, we talked about what we're seeing on the check side, that's also a positive sign. So we think there is, you know, just as we cycle through some of the weakness, that should help us gradually get better through the year.David Tarantino: Got it. And then, Rick, on Olive Garden, I guess a question I would have is on the advertising approach, do you see an opportunity to better highlight the value you're already offering? Not necessarily provide a new discount or something different than what you're adding, but it seems like that brand has a great value proposition. I'm just wondering if you think there's an opportunity to emphasize that a bit more in the advertising?Rick Cardenas: Yes, David and that's exactly what we're doing right now. You know, on TV right now, we've got our Create Your Own Pasta at $12.99 with the price point on the television. And, you know, we do believe that Olive Garden has a great everyday value. And so what we -- the things that we can do to continue to highlight that versus discounting is what we'll continue to do.David Tarantino: Great. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jim Salera with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions.Jim Salera: Hi guys, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Can you just give us some of the puts and takes on the 3% inflation guide for 2025, particularly what you're thinking around the food basket and labor?Raj Vennam: Yes, Jim. So this is Raj. So on the food basket, we're basically assuming commodities to be around 2%. I think the biggest driver within the food basket is beef. We still expect beef to be in the mid-single-digits. And then we actually expect low-single-digit deflation in chicken. And then pretty much all other categories are probably going to be in that low-single-digit inflation. And so that's how we're getting to commodities being around 2%. From a labor perspective, we are actually expecting labor to be more like a 4% overall. So if you think about where we've been and what the hourly wage inflation is expected to be closer to 4% and then total labor to be around 4%. So those are the two big things. And then from all other restaurant expenses are probably going to be more in that 2.5% to 3%. And that's how we're getting to that overall being closer to 3%.Jim Salera: Okay, great. Thanks for the detail on that. And then if I could maybe try to tie that to the consumer. You mentioned earlier one of the concerns or chief concerns for the consumer is just kind of overall inflation. If we see inflation maybe come in at the lower end of your expectations. Is it possible that, that could also provide better-than-expected lift on the comp side, given that consumers maybe feel a little bit better about how far their dollar goes? Just trying to think of kind of the catalyst path for the consumer into 2025, what might make the results from the consumer be better than what you're anticipating?Rick Cardenas: Yes, Jim, The consumer is really focused on what price they're paying in everywhere, not just in restaurants. And if you think about the cost that they have on the non-discretionary costs, they've been growing faster than wages for quite a few years, and that eats into discretionary spending. So if inflation in the non-discretionary gets better, that may give them a little bit more discretionary. And if you're considering food at the grocery store or food a non-discretionary, then yes, that should help. But we'd like to see some lower inflation in things like things that people have to buy. Rent, utilities, child care, all of those things would help on the non-discretionary side, help discretionary spend.Jim Salera: That's great. Thanks for the color, guys. I'll hop back in the queue.Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.Sara Senatore: Great, thank you. I guess, I wanted one clarification and then a question, please. The clarification is just, you mentioned pricing, like 1% in Olive Garden and pricing below inflation, but your food margins were better than we had expected. So I just wanted to understand like what the dynamic might have been across brands, whether there was any mix. I mean, presumably all of them actually some of the best food margins. So if you could just help me unpack that a little bit. And then I do have a question about the demand environment.Raj Vennam: Yes, Sara. Good morning. So when we look at the fourth quarter, yes, our pricing was across Darden was below inflation. I think our pricing was closer to 2.5, inflation was around 3. So there is a board. I think the delta was almost 70 basis points. But that, again, goes back to the testament of our teams and our ability to manage through different cycles, right, through different environments. We've talked about how in a slow growth environment, we should see costs get better, but also we should see our own -- the controllables be even more -- come in even better. So ultimately, it's just a testament to our teams, how well they manage the business, with the focus on getting to the returns we need to get for the business.Sara Senatore: Okay, and those controllables sit even in the cog line?Raj Vennam: There is some, yes.Sara Senatore: Okay, got it. Thank you. And then the question on demand is, to some of the earlier comments you've made, perhaps the demand environment is softer-than-expected in so far as the issue with your comps is you're still taking share, but I'm interpreting it to mean perhaps versus where we expected, given the low-income consumer primarily, I think. I'm trying to, I guess, ask when you think about where that expectation was when you acquired Ruth and kind of doubled down on fine dining, had you anticipated something more robust or there was always an expectation of normalization and even in that context the acquisition makes sense.Rick Cardenas: Hey, Sara. This is Rick. When we acquired Ruth's, we think about an acquisition over a long, long period of time. We're not as worried about the next quarter or the quarter after the acquisition. Now, would we have liked the consumer at the below-median income to continue to go to fine dining? Absolutely, but any time we make an acquisition, there could be a chance that it's because we're going into a slowdown and maybe there's a little bit of a better opportunity for price discovery there. So, I would never read into when we make an acquisition into a certain category or not. Remember, we have criteria for our M&A and Ruth's met every one of that criteria, and we were able to agree on our price. So that's why it happened at the time it happened. And generally, that's when any of our M&A will happen, as long as we find the brands that meet the criteria and we get price discovery and we agree on a price and we'll do that deal, we're not worried about the environment that we're going into or that we're coming out of because these are long, long-term investments for us.Sara Senatore: That makes sense. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you. Rick, my first question is just on the weakening conditions you mentioned in the back half, it does seem like within your portfolio, at least, Olive Garden was hit harder, and I guess relative to the industry as well, which I think is contrary to past economic slowdowns when most people look at Olive Garden as the more defensive value brand. So I'm just wondering, as you take a step back, what do you think has changed this go-around? How much of it is maybe internally what you're doing versus maybe what the competition is doing and if you can give any sequential color on the trends through the quarter or into June just to kind of get a sense of how we're starting fiscal ‘25, that would be great. And then I had one follow-up.Rick Cardenas: Sure, Jeff. I'm not going to talk about the trends into fiscal ‘25 where we are. And I think Raj had mentioned that the quarterly -- fourth quarter, we were pretty consistent month-over-month, month to month to month. So -- but I will say for Olive Garden, in prior slowdowns, Olive Garden outperformed. They outperformed at the same restaurant sales and at that time they were taking more pricing than everybody else. We outperformed this quarter in traffic and we've continued to outperform the industry in traffic for the last many years and we only took 1% pricing. What I would tell you is that if we would have taken the pricing that the industry took in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter, I'm sorry, Olive Garden would have been positive and would have performed even more. And so this is a long game for us. The other thing that we aren't -- that we're not pulling are things that everybody or not everybody, but people used to pull in slowdowns, couponing, deep discounting and all those other things and we're not doing that even at a time that our competitors have ramped up discounting, deep discounting on television and, you know, Olive Garden still outperformed in traffic, didn't outperform in comp sales, but as I said, we only took 1% pricing. And so we're really, really proud of that and we'll continue to do that. And maybe that's why we didn't outperform on the sales side, but we did continue to outperform on the traffic side. And I just want to say their gap in fiscal Q4 was 60 basis points in traffic, and their two-year gap is 530 basis points in traffic. So we feel pretty good with where they are.Jeffrey Bernstein: Absolutely. And then my follow-up, Raj, as you think about, well, as you're setting up a guidance for fiscal ‘25, you mentioned how in fiscal ‘24, you beat your initial EPS guidance despite seemingly falling short on the initial fiscal ‘24 comp guidance and as you look at ‘25 wondering as we enter the year it seems like maybe if there was a risk that it's the same scenario where I mean just looking at the fourth quarter your comps were below the fiscal ‘25 guide. So what leverage do you have on the margin and earnings side to maybe beat the comps -- if the comps would again fall short as we move through fiscal ‘25? It would seem like you don't have as much opportunity with inflation easing as maybe you had this past year. So how do you think about the outlook for fiscal ‘25 if the comps were to fall short? Thank you.Raj Vennam: Hey, Jeff. So I don't want to get into the exact details, but let me say a high level and talk about how we think about philosophically, right? If the environment is such that the sales continue to be weaker, that also implies the demand is weaker and the inflation should be a little bit better. So let's start with that. And in fact, if you look at last year, that was part of the reason we were able to exceed the earnings guidance even with the sales off. That's not all of it, but that's partial. The other part of it is how we manage through the -- through how our teams manage through the cycle. So as I said earlier, our restaurant teams and our teams at the support center work very hard to kind of, you know, have these targets and we work towards them and we're always trying to get better. And there's just even more push on that when things are a little bit softer on the top line. So that's kind of how I talk about it. I don't want to get into the specifics because, you know, this is a big business. It's very complex. There are a lot of nuances. There's a lot of -- but there's a lot that goes in to get to where we need to get to. And we feel, I think if you just look back, it shows that we have the ability to get there to a different base.Jeffrey Bernstein: Understood. Thanks, Raj.Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions.David Palmer: Thanks. Good morning. Olive Garden's strategy has been to sort of set itself up as a well-positioned everyday value and a strong consumer service. Do you see the consumer recognizing this? Like are the consumer satisfaction scores at Olive Garden doing as well versus the peer group in Italian as say LongHorn or  Texas Roadhouse  (NASDAQ:TXRH) are doing in stake?Rick Cardenas: Yes, David, I won't comment on how they're doing versus their competition, but I can tell you as Olive Garden, both internally and externally, their value ratings have increased over this last year. And they're pretty close to the top end of the value and overall in the measures we look at. I also mentioned they were kind of at the highest levels of guest satisfaction in this fiscal year. But again, they continue in all of our brands. Most of our brands -- I think all of our brands were at or above their value perceptions externally versus last year?David Palmer: Yes. I guess, I'm wondering why you think the traffic share gains are not stronger. Is it just simply the consumer awareness of the value that's at Olive Garden? Or is it perhaps something about the Italian category, such as the ease of trading down to at-home posts a little easier we're seeing very strong growth in, for instance, Rayo’s Sauces lately. So we're seeing scratch cooking really picking up in at-home, we're not seeing a strong stake demand at-home. So I'm wondering if there's sort of an interaction index with at-home trade down that's stronger in the Italian category. Do you have any thoughts on that?Rick Cardenas: Well, there may be interaction trade down to at-home because of the median income consumer, it's not necessarily the Italian. But I can tell you where we compete in the full service base, Olive Garden was at 75th percentile in their traffic. So -- and again, when you're comparing how they're doing in full service. And then we're putting in this at-home, everybody is dealing with the at-home as well, not just Italian. And then finally, the competitors had ramped up very deep discounting and while we had -- we didn't see that actually impacting Olive Garden or our other brands, because the trends kind of stayed similar. What we did see, interestingly, is a little bit of a shift from QSR to some of those competitors. And so that might be where they're trying to take some share from. But we did see that and that lifted the industry index in some of those -- and maybe one of those competitors, which is a big part of the index. So there's a little bit of a nuance in how the index works, especially when you're taking share from another category -- another part of the index.David Palmer: Great. Thank you very much.Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.Dennis Geiger: Great. Thanks, guys. Just wondering if you could speak to the development environment a bit more. It seems like consistent expectations as it relates to new builds. But anything you're seeing there sort of on timing, thinking about build cost, et cetera?Rick Cardenas: Yes, Dennis. I will -- let me start by saying that the new restaurant projection we have for next year is within our long-term framework. So while it's lower than we like it to be, it's still within our long-term framework. And recall, the new restaurants also include M&A. So we bought about 80 restaurants from Ruth’s Chris that were part of last year. Now that's not impacting this year, but it is part of our framework construction costs are still quite a bit higher than they were before COVID, but the levels are normalizing more and it's still taking a little longer to get construction starts. We're just trying to figure out ways to improve our process to potentially get starts moving a little bit faster. And maybe there is some things that we can do to help municipalities with kind of working on permitting and other things, But we feel pretty good about our pipeline for next year. We'd like to see it higher for the years after, but we're not going to just build restaurants and put a number out there that we don't think that we can hit, and we feel pretty good about where we are. And again, Raj showed you where we were for the last five years in our new unit growth. It was almost 3%. It was 2.9%, which is at the high-end of our framework. So we don't necessarily think year-to-year, we think long-term.Dennis Geiger: Thanks, Rick. And one more, just curious if you could comment a little more on sort of what your expectation is for the industry promotional environment for the year. Is what we're seeing sustainable? Can it increase? I know there's 1 million factors that go into this. But just given your perspective, would love any thoughts on what over the next three quarters or so, what the industry environment on promo discounting, et cetera, looks like in your opinion? Thank you.Rick Cardenas: Yes, Dennis, I think my perspective is -- we like what we're doing better, right? We don't think that we think that everyday low value and continue to focus on our core equities is more sustainable than deep discounting to try to drive people in. Others can do that, and we'll continue to play this long game. And over time, you have to keep wrapping on that. If you do a deep discount and it stays the same way, you have to do even more the next year, you have to do more television. And we just think we'd rather do more great food, more great service, and let's wrap that. And so again, I can't comment on what other people think is sustainable or not. We just think our business, the way we do it is more sustainable.Dennis Geiger: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.Peter Saleh: Great, thanks. Raj, I wanted to ask on the flat mix, which I think you mentioned was a pretty meaningful improvement from what you've seen in the past couple of quarters. Can you just give us a little bit more detail on what's driving this? Is this alcohol mix improving entrees consumers trading up to more expensive entree, the appetizers. And is there any way to dissect this by income cohort? Are you seeing more improvement from the lower income, higher income, anything you can glean there?Raj Vennam: Hey Peter. Yes, just to start, that was specifically at Olive Garden and LongHorn. And so when we look at -- and it's different for both brands. So when you look at LongHorn the mix was driven by some add-ons, increased add-ons. They had a great -- they also had a new Lamb Entree that actually was that did really well. There was parmesan crusting, people wanted to get more of that. So there were things like that were helpful with the mix. What we -- alcohol is kind of fairly stabilized. So it's not necessarily a headwind anymore. And so that's probably helping but when you look at Olive Garden, the same thing where people are not -- we're not seeing as much trade down within the -- whether it's the entree trade down or not getting add-ons. So just in general, more stabilization and so maybe this is -- the guest that's coming in today is not managing the check as much. And so that's different from maybe some of the guests that were coming in earlier in the fiscal year.Peter Saleh: Great. Thank you very much.Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your questions.Jeff Farmer: Great. Good morning and thank you. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. With the 1% to 2% FY ‘25 same-store sales guidance, you pointed to the 2.5% to 3% menu pricing. But can you give us a little bit of color as it relates to both traffic and mix assumptions for FY ‘25 guidance?Raj Vennam: Yes, I think it's fair to assume that our check is probably going to be in that range of 2.5% to 3%. So you can back into the implied traffic. So we do expect the mix to be fairly flat.Jeff Farmer: Okay. And then I might have missed it, but G&A dollars in FY ‘25, did you provide that guidance?Raj Vennam: You did not miss it. We haven't talked about it. The G&A for this year, we should be closer to $450 million for fiscal '21, it should be closer to $450 million. And I think that's going to be spread fairly evenly from second to the fourth quarter, with the first quarter to be $20 million higher than those three quarters. It's just typical that we have a little bit more in the first half.Jeff Farmer: All right. Appreciate it. Thank you.Raj Vennam: Yes.Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jon Tower with Citi. Please proceed with your questions.Jon Tower: Great, thanks. I appreciate you taking. Going to the cost side of the equation, it was pretty impressive even with the comp that you put up in the fourth quarter, how you were able to manage labor and the other op expense line very well. And I'm just curious if you could dig into how you expect those lines to play out in fiscal '24 or better said, do you think a lot of the management that you're able to put in across labor as well as the other OpEx can carry forward into fiscal '25 kind of offsetting some of that inflation that you're seeing.Raj Vennam: Hi, John, so if you look at the drivers this year, we talked about improved productivity. That was -- a part of that was also driven by lower turnover. And so there may be a few quarters where we'll still get a little bit of that benefit, but as we look to next year, I would expect -- we would expect COGS to be better because commodities inflation is likely going to be, as I said, closer to that 2% and then pricing being a little bit more, you should get some leverage on that line. We do expect to continue to look at other OpEx, right? That's one of the things non-guest-facing cost is where we spend a lot of time looking at how do we continue to get better. And that's the power of the platform. That's the power of having this big multiple brands and being able to learn from each other. And the last piece is, there is some continuing synergies from Ruth's acquisition that we talked about. We got about half this year. We're going to get the rest next year. So those are all different drivers of how we get that margin growth.Jon Tower: Got it. Thank you. And I know a lot has been talked about today on the marketing side. So I'm just curious, one more, I guess, on the topic. In terms of the way that you're speaking to the consumer, I know you're using traditional television as a primary means to communicate Olive Garden's message. But I'm just curious if you could dig into what you're doing on social and how you might be changing the brand's perception on those platforms or even in traditional media, are you going after different day parts in terms of where you're advertising even platforms where you're advertising through linear media. Maybe just more information there would be great.Rick Cardenas: Yes, John. For several years, we've been building our internal digital media capabilities, and we've done -- Olive Garden is the only one on television. Everybody else does spend marketing and it's in digital. And we've been testing things like connected television. We've been testing other things to help drive our traffic. And because we've been testing this allows us to kind of move them into other brands to see how they work. We do a lot of test and learn -- and so we don't expect our media to grow significantly year-over-year because we think we're more efficient with the tests that we do. And so as we continue to do that, we know what the right times to put messages out there. We know what days and we knew all those things. So we're not necessarily going to think about ramping up a communication of a certain day part unless the brand thinks it's the right thing to do. And so they might -- we might see some brands talk about a certain day part or not. But we are using our digital that we've learned over the years and we have an internal team here that's great at what they do and we'll continue to focus on that.Jon Tower: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.Chris O'Cull: Yes thanks. Rick, you mentioned several sales building opportunities earlier. But I was wondering if you think there are any opportunities to improve throughput during high demand peak periods at Olive Garden? I'm assuming the restaurants are still in a way during traditional peak periods like Friday and Saturday nights.Rick Cardenas: Yes, Chris, I think not just at Olive Garden, but all our brands can do more to improve throughput in our peak periods. We can get a little bit quicker in what we do to make sure that the guest doesn't feel rush, but they don't feel like they're waiting for a lot of things. So we do think that there's opportunities and not just at Olive Garden, and if we can do that better, we should get some -- at least some traffic in that day if people were walking away. But in the long run, getting a little bit quicker, maybe better for us any day, not just on the peak periods.Chris O'Cull: Okay. And then, Raj, Olive Garden segment margin contracted, I think, 70 basis points this quarter, while the other segments or the other segments saw some considerable year-over-year expansion. Can you help us understand what drove that pressure? And do you see other -- those factors putting pressure on Olive Garden this going into fiscal '25.Raj Vennam: No, Chris, I think it's actually just kind of normalizing what they should have been, right? Last year, I think we had a little too high margin. I mean, to be 22.8% segment profit margin is industry leading. I mean that's just -- that's just really high. That would be aspirational for a lot of brands in this industry. So to be able to get to those levels. And frankly, it goes back to the -- our decision to not price as much, right? And we had talked about it last year. We didn't think 23.5% segment profit was the right number. That was a little too high. And so it's really giving back a little bit of that. But we don't expect that to be like a -- as we look -- move forward, we don't expect that to be a drag going forward. It's just more of -- there were some things that needed to be normalized.Chris O'Cull: Perfect. Thanks, guys.Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.Danilo Gargiulo: Raj, given your focus on more profitable traffic and cost control, cost management in this environment, can you help us understand the flow-through of the marginal dollar today and how it compares with the marginal dollar flow-through back in, say, 2019?Raj Vennam: Hey Danilo, I think the flow-through from the marginal dollar is not that different. It is actually fairly similar. It's just there are other things that are more non-variable costs that we're also looking at. So it's not -- that's how we're getting to that. But from a high level, if you look at across the portfolio, somewhere around 35% to 40% is probably the right flow-through to think about it. And I don't think that's any different from where we were before in 2019.Danilo Gargiulo: Okay, thank you. And Rick, just from a long-term perspective, can you share maybe the rationale and timing behind these recent executive changes? And in particular, what you're expecting from your team in their newly created roles and specifically, if you can comment on kind of post promotion and kind of the role of the Chief Business Development Officer, what are you expecting out of that? Thank you.Rick Cardenas: Yes, Danilo, as I said in the prepared remarks, these changes help set us up for future growth and developing our leaders. So if you think about Todd and John elevating their roles a little bit, Todd leading development, international and franchising and Ruth's Chris. And those all have really good synergies for Todd, right? So development in new restaurants, that's for all brands but international franchising with the percent of restaurants that Ruth's Chris has his franchise, it's actually a pretty good synergy there. Plus, as I said, Todd, came with -- came to us from rare hospitality when we bought them. So he knows what it's like after the systems integration and how to help people assimilate more. And he'll help Rick, who's our new President, become a great President. And then finally, as I mentioned, having an operator’s perspective and new restaurant development, I think, is a pretty good thing to do. We think about how to do the turnovers better how to get -- make sure we are more planful in telling the brands when we think the restaurant is going to open. So there aren't moves and delays, so we can get those a little bit better. So that's really where Todd comes into play. And then on John's side, if you think about the specialty restaurant group with five brands and John leading all five, that was a lot. And so how do we help bring him up and bring the new president underneath John, who are all proven leaders and all have a good future here with us, while John can help them become even better brand presidents. A couple of them -- one of them is a former finance person, but he's got a great operations knowledge, and he actually was a restaurant manager many, many years ago. But John can help Mark become a better general manager and think more about operations. You've got Falon Farrell, who's now going to be leading Capital Grille and Eddie V's. Actually, Falon started at Capital Grille as a team member, and she worked at Capital Grille for many years. And then she led training for Capital Grille, and Eddie V’s. And now she -- then she led Eddie V’s for quite a while in operation. So she can see how do we bring some synergies in the support center for Capital Grille and Eddie V’s to help leverage those brands better, but while working for John who can continue to develop her for the future. And then I think about Bryan Clements. Bryan, his history, he started a big bar brands years ago. He spent many years at LongHorn to understand how LongHorn and a simple operating model works and he spent time at Olive Garden, leading Olive Garden operations, and that's a big system. And how do you think about a big system when you've got Yard House who's passing 80 restaurants, and we want to continue to grow them, and he can help with more system thinking at Yard House. So we think it's a really great move for all of them. And Laura, I didn't mention Laura is a great leader here at Darden. And she spent nine years at LongHorn. She really knows LongHorn. And she's got a great relationship with Todd. She'll be able to continue to talk to Todd and the team at LongHorn has rallied around her. So our reasoning behind that is to get people ready, while other people are basically retirement eligible. And so we want to make sure that they're here to help them progress. And you know what our retirement programs are not saying that anybody is leaving anytime soon, but this gives them a chance to develop people while they're still around.Danilo Gargiulo: Great. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.Andy Barish: Hey guys, two quick ones. Just hearing some commentary on the softer Florida market where you guys kind of over-index, any thoughts there? And then if you could give us the Olive Garden to Go mix for the fiscal year '24 versus '23? And is there -- any trends you're seeing there, any impact on maybe some of the same-store sales components, just not remembering how you guys calculate that fully?Raj Vennam: All right. Andy, let's start with the trends themselves. So if we actually look at the last quarter, and I may have mentioned in the prior quarter, too, but Florida, Texas and California generally were a little bit weaker. We saw that not just Florida, but Texas and California. And did contribute to the top line being where it was. And so that's -- I don't know that we have a strong explanation for why one of the thoughts was maybe some of these markets that opened faster coming out of COVID might be the ones where we're seeing a little bit of softness and maybe a little bit of strength on the ones that opened a little bit later coming out of COVID but that's just a hypothesis. But that's -- the facts are, you're seeing some strength in the New England market and other things and not as much in California, Texas and Florida. As we look at our to-go mix, -- to go mix at Olive Garden was basically at -- I think for the year, 24%, which is fairly similar to last year, not a huge -- not much change. And LongHorn is at 14% think we saw a little bit of an improvement year-over-year like 1 point or so at LongHorn on the quarter, but that's just fairly stabilized there. And I think there was another question about some mix I can't -- what was the -- was there another one, Andy, that I missed?Andy Barish: Yes. No. Just if the to-go trend had or decline if that was impacting any of the components of same-store sales, but it doesn't sound like that.Raj Vennam: No, it's not yes.Andy Barish: Okay, thank you.Raj Vennam: Yes.Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions.Brian Vaccaro: Hey, thanks. And good morning. I know we're running off. So just two quick ones for me. Can you provide traffic and check for Olive Garden and LongHorn in the fourth quarter? And then, Raj, did I hear correctly blended price up 2.5% to 3% for the fiscal '25 and that seems stable. So does that suggest you've taken price recently? And could see that range as early as the first quarter?Raj Vennam: Yes, Brian, the blended -- let me start with the later question first. Yes, the blended in the 2.5% to 3%. We have taken some pricing -- we are -- yes, typically, we take some in June, so there's some pricing. So you should start to see some of that in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, our total check growth was 2.2% at Darden level, I think Olive Garden was more like a one-third, and LongHorn was probably in the 3-ish percent, LongHorn has positive traffic. The traffic growth, I think, in the quarter was 0.8%. So in the total SRS is 4%, so the check growth was at on 3.2%.Brian Vaccaro: Thanks very much.Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your questions.Jake Bartlett: Great, thanks for taking the question. I want to dig in on that last question and answer a little bit more, and that's pricing at Olive Garden. Pricing decelerated to 1% in the fourth quarter. You talked about comps being similar across the brand in '25 and pretty stable pricing throughout the year. Does that imply that you're going to see a pretty big step-up in menu price at Olive Garden? Or should we expect kind of a similar, much more cautious pricing at Olive Garden throughout the whole year?Raj Vennam: I'm sorry, I was on mute. If you look at Olive Garden's pricing for the year, fiscal year, they were actually close to mid-3s. And so that's pretty consistent, not all the way to where Darden blended was 4. So they're about 50 or 70, 80 basis points below Darden. As we think about next year, they're not going to -- we would expect them to be maybe in the 30, 40 basis points range of where Darden might end up. So I don't expect this to be as big of a gap. But we're still -- we're not talking about huge pricing actions, right? We talked about -- there is always some timing of the quarter-to-quarter. But on the year, if we think 2.5% to 3%, Olive Garden is probably closer to 2.5%Jake Bartlett: Got it. But I think that would imply that in the near-term, you'd be taking up pricing in Olive Garden in this environment, this macro environment. I'm wondering whether you think that creates a little bit of risk to traffic even from where we started. If you can maybe answer that, but then I also just had a follow-up on the Fast Recovery Act in California, and you guys have a decent presence there, and I think we haven't gotten a lot of commentary about the impact. It seems like some pretty seismic impacts in California impact on labor, but also shift in demand maybe from limited service into casual dining. So any comment there on what you've seen over the last few months as the -- as the fast recovery actually implemented?Rick Cardenas: Hey Jake, this is Rick. I'm going to start on the fact act with saying that our employment proposition is great in California. So we've got a great one there. On average, our team members earn well over $20 an hour. And California only represents about 5% of our restaurants. So it's not like it's an over-index for us. We haven't seen a real impact in wages. And since the FAST Act came about, but unfortunately, we have seen many closures of fast food restaurants in that time. And so our California performance for the quarter was still not as strong as the company, as you said. But as Raj said, we did see some softness in California, but I think that was more related to some weather there than anything else. But again, we haven't seen a whole lot of change in our wages. Our employment proposition is great in California. But we have seen some fast food restaurants, unfortunately, have to close because of the act.Jake Bartlett: Thank you. [Technical Difficulty] can you price at Olive Garden now in this environment?Raj Vennam: So Jake, I'll go back to the pricing actions, some of this is timing of when you take actions. Every year, there's a little bit of pricing action, right? And this year, or in fiscal '24, we did not have any pricing action until pretty late into maybe Q4, middle of Q4. So that's just already there. It's not a lot of pricing on top. Some of that is also moving to years, right, some restaurants in different markets as things change with the environment and minimum wage, we make some adjustments. But nothing crazy. If you look at -- I mentioned earlier and in response to a different question, we have taken a lot less pricing at Olive Garden. So we're not worried about where they are. I mean if you look at over the five years, cumulatively, their CAGR is probably more in the 3.5% range when the industry is closer to 5% plus. So we feel like there's a better -- great value proposition at Olive Garden, and we try to keep prices as low as we can, and you've seen that.Jake Bartlett: Great, thank you very much.Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Gregory Francfort with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your questions.Gregory Francfort: Hey, thanks for the question. My question is just -- I think it was asked on unit growth earlier in the call, and you guys were suggesting it makes sense to look at the long-term. I think you're opening up 15 to 20 or so Olive Gardens a year, which is one of the faster paces of growth we've seen in a long time. How many stores do you think Olive Garden could have on a long-term basis? You have a lot of competitors that are up at 1,200, 700 stores with a lot lower AUVs. Just sort of curious how you come up with the long-term target for Olive Garden. Thanks.Rick Cardenas: Greg, let me start by saying every time we come up with a target for Olive Garden, we blow past it. So we haven't really talked about a target for Olive Garden for a lot of years. What we have found over the last five or 10 years is that we can open more Olive Gardens in markets that Olive Gardens are already in, where prior to that, we weren't doing that as much. Convenience is important to consumers, and we'd rather be a little closer where they live. And so we do believe there's opportunities to open Olive Gardens for the foreseeable future, and we don't think we're near the top of the Olive Garden limit yet. Greg, did you have any other questions?Gregory Francfort: No, no, that was it. I appreciate the perspective. Thanks.Rick Cardenas: Thank you so much.Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Strelzick with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.Andrew Strelzick: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I just had two quick ones for me. There's been a lot of discussion about the low-income consumer. I think last quarter, you said that you saw growth with the higher-end consumer at all of your segments. So I was hoping we could get an update there on how that is trending, if that's still what you're realizing. And then -- my second question is about the balance sheet, and you mentioned leverage being below the target. It's been that way for a bit now. So I'm just curious how you're thinking about what might narrow that gap or how you're thinking about leverage on the balance sheet going forward? Thanks.Raj Vennam: Andrew, let's start with the question around the incomes. We are seeing the higher income being a little bit better, and it varies from brand to brand. And as you can imagine, when you think about a brand that grew traffic for LongHorn, for example, they actually had growth pretty much across all income segments. But from a fine dining perspective, you're seeing growth at the higher end I wouldn't say that's just the median household. It actually has to go up north of 150 to see where we're seeing some growth. And then the pullback is mostly at the lower -- at the below middle median household income. And then the other segments are -- other income groups or cohorts are either stable or growing. And then on the balance sheet, we always work with our Board to figure out what's the best way to kind of really position ourselves. We like the flexibility we have -- and as we've always said, we want to use our balance sheet to get productive assets over time. And so that's still -- the philosophy remains the same.Andrew Strelzick: Great. Thank you very much.Operator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Courtney Aquilla for closing remarks.Courtney Aquilla: That concludes our call.
