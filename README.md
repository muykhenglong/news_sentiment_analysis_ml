# News Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes Classifier

This Python script performs sentiment analysis on news articles using a Naive Bayes classifier. The script reads a dataset, preprocesses text data, and applies machine learning techniques to classify news as positive or negative based on their content.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Drops unnecessary columns from the dataset.
- **Text Vectorization**: Converts text data into numerical format using CountVectorizer and TF-IDF.
- **Model Training**: Uses Gaussian Naive Bayes for training the sentiment analysis model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
- **Cross-validation**: Performs cross-validation to assess the robustness of the model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.12
